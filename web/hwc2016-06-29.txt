#indieweb @t: welcome to Homebrew Website Club - this is the first one at Mozilla since the Indieweb Summit
#indieweb @t: This weekend we're going to change the main url from indiewebcamp.com to indieweb.org
#indieweb @t: we discussed this on the wiki at http://indiewebcamp.com/rename_to_IndieWeb and how to move the chat logs
#indieweb @t: we're plannign on splitting the channels to indieweb, indieweb-dev and indieweb-chat
#indieweb @shurcooL: I discovered indieweb a week ago, and the values and motivations were thinking along the same lines
#indieweb @shurcooL: I found indieweb through someone's personal website.
#indieweb @shurcooL: I used to make games to inspire people but now I make tools instead
#indieweb @shurcooL: I like simplicity and correctness -  I was using C++ up until a couple of years ago, but now I'm using go alone
#indieweb @shurcooL: my website is at https://dmitri.shuralyov.com and is pretty basic, but I have a lot of go-based projects in github
#indieweb @shurcooL: so I wanted to make the github issue tracker for myself 
#indieweb @veganstraightedge: During quiet writing hour I wrote that my girlfriend and I decided to live in SF for the summer
#indieweb @veganstraightedge: we base our wiki profiles on URLs at the moment, and it it a mess - the wiki is not good at structured data
#indieweb @veganstraightedge: @gregorlove made an infobox for users to use in the wiki, but it is dtll a ness
#indieweb @t: ythis kind of grew organicall
#indieweb @veganstraightedge: so we adopted the sparlkine template model, but that means we end up wiht a DRY problem
#indieweb @veganstraightedge: if you go to http://h-card-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/ you can fill in your site and get an h-card back
#indieweb @veganstraightedge: as well as names we can specify pronouns so people can be addressed correctly by Loqi
#indieweb @veganstraightedge: I think editing a form is easier than filling in a wiki page
#indieweb @veganstraightedge: this link http://h-card-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/chat-people is a replacement for the name lookup that we use for irc now
#indieweb @veganstraightedge: we need to work on making authorship work rather than just first h-card on the page eg kevinmarks.com 
#indieweb @shurcooL: I got github issues working on my own site: http://gotools.org:34601/github.com/gorilla/mux/issues/174
#indieweb @shurcooL: then I wrote an adaptor to turn my blog dump into the issue tracker interface
#indieweb @shurcooL: rather than build my own user registration system I enables github login for comments
#indieweb @shurcooL: my blog is at https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/blog and you can comment there with github logins
#indieweb @shurcooL: and I added emoji reactions too
#indieweb @shurcooL: after making emoji reactions work I imported LinkedIN data to my blog so you can react to my skills with emoji
#indieweb @shurcooL: after discovering what people are doing with webmentions my next job is for people to own their reactions
#indieweb @shurcooL: if you view source you see that my pages are compiled from go into javascript
#indieweb @shurcooL: ideally I'd render on the backend and show it as HTML too so you can parse it
#indieweb @shurcooL: I publish straight from my projects page to my site
#indieweb @shurcooL: all my personal stuff is open source so you can work on this 
#indieweb @t: we had the Indieweb summit in portland wiht about 50 people attending
#indieweb @t: a couple of days after that we had the w3c SocialWG meeting pushing Micropub and Webmention to CR
#indieweb @t: 2 days after that we had the decentralizedweb.net summit at the internet archive that covered indieweb too
#indieweb @t: we organised a homebrew website club popup in London, and that is now supposed to be monthly
#indieweb @t: last week was Open Source Bridge in Portland, and @aaronpk gave a talk on standardizing the social web
#indieweb @t: and Nuremburg held an Indieweb hack day last week
