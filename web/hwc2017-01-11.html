<p>"to radically shift the global economy toward life-fulfilling independent ventures" is the indieweb part of this
<p>our enemy is people who want to control the web and siphon the web off into silos and keep the profits
<p>we want each individual member of our communities to start their own business about their purpose in life
<p>and the web is how we see making that happen - finding your niche within the business ecosystem
<p>How can we vote with our dollars for the world that we want, by building to empower ourselves?
<p>The vote of your time and money is the one that no-one can take away from you, whoever is in power
<p>and GoDaddy is now about getting you online for your life-fulfilling venture

<p>get people to sign up for the email list that you send out from your own domain
<p>It's so easy to set up a facebook page, and more work to set up a webpage. We need to make it easy to have both
<p>I used to work with musicians, and they would make MySpace pages, which may now have gone
<p>If they printed their own domain on the CDs, they are in control of where it is at the moment
<p>You get to decide what is real and what is fake - if it's on a silo, they can wipe you out in one go
