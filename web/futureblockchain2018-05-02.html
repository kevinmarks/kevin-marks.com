<p>lets talk about real numbers and real statistics - Brock did you pull them out of your cowboy hat?

<p>now there is an incentive to develop a new protocol - when TCP/IP was invented you couldn't own it, but with Eos etc you have an incentive to make new ones

<p>Most people aren't going to understand how the technology works - you need use cases to show it to them

<p>Putting Wikipedia on the blockchain will give people an incentive to contribute. The protocol will support all kinds of encyclopedia article competing on the same topics
<p>We're building everipedia on Eos, and there will be an IQ token launched. If you have Eos you will have some IQ tokens. 
<p>Everipedia is a superset of Wikipedia - because wikipedia is Creative commons we can fork it and edit the articles

<p>Teh Dubai Blockchain strategy rests on 3 pillars: first we will make all Government transactions on blockchain by 2020
<p>The 2nd pillar is to provide an enabling ecosystem to empower developers - we had blockchain developers picth in 2017 and in2018 - the winning ideas will be annoucned tomorrow
<p>the 3rd pillar is to position Dubai as a global thought leader in blockchain by hosting events like this one to encourage developments
<p>Smart Dubai doesn't view technology as an end, but as a way to improve people's lives - we want to put technology at the service of human beings

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://uaecabinet.ae/en/details/cabinet-members/his-excellency-omar-bin-sultan-al-olama'>Omar bin Sultam al Olama</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>The Prime Minister thinks that adopting Blockchain will improve the happiness of people
<p>We have been trying out the possibilities of Blockchain for 2 years before adopting it for government
<p>the whole world is moving to a future that is more decentralized, and we need more safety and security
<p>we see Blockchain as the si,plest most secure way to exchange national data
<p>the WEF sees UAE as the most efficient government on earth - Governtment efficiency is key
<p>secondly we want to create industries based on this new tehcnology
<p>and finally we want to be the example for otehr governements
<p>we have 389 million government documents a year  - we want 50% of them on the blockchain - saving 77 Million hours and 1.6 billion km of driving
<p>the commitment is 50% of UAE government transactions on the blockchain by 2021 - if that succeeds we will move to 100% after that
<p>we want ot be the most future ready government in the world. 
<p>we will implement  blockchain in education, healthcare and real estate to help citizens, make government efficent in energy, identification and security, to put legislation in place to encourage this 
<p>We are going to adopt AI to make government processes more efficient
<p>AI and Encryption complement one another - with AI you can't tell how  it made a decision - blockchain can help us keep a record of how the decisions were made
<p>Combining Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence is key - [shows this cartoon] <a class="auto-link" href="https://marketoonist.com/2018/01/blockchain.html">https://marketoonist.com/2018/01/blockchain.html</a>

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/wesamlootah'>Wesam Lootah</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We've heard from His Excellency about the UAE level, I'm going to talk about the Dubai level. If you're  a blockchain expert please stand up
<p>Yes, blockchain was not invented in Dubai, Satoshi Nakomoto is not a Dubai citizen
<p>we want to be the blockchain capital of the world. If you have spent any time in Dubai over the last 10 years you can see that we make big promises and we deliver
<p>The no fake news CNN has called us the Capital of Blockchain
<p>Sheikh Al Maktoum announced that Dubai will be fully powered by Blockchain by 2020. We believe that we are the architects of the future, and so should you.
<p>We are enabling government services and setting up the regulatory environment to encourage a blockchain ecosystem for startups and businesses here
<p>we are using blockchain to make city transactions more efficient and settle quickly, including renting and buying property. We're putting all the commercial registries on one blockchain
<p>some of these things haven't been done before - we believe Dubai is the testbed for this technology.
<p>This hasn't been easy - it hasn't all been roses and flowers
<p>What we learned: You need buy in from top leadership. Don't focus on the technology, but start with customer experience. Map out the pain points, and then design a future state.
<p>There will be technical challenges, and blockchain brings many parties involved by default.
<p>Put into your plan that there will be 20-30% reworking during the project. If you can use Blockchain as a service, that will simplify things.
<p>we want to make Dubai the happiest city on earth

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.larrysanger.org/'>Larry Sanger</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm working on everipedia - it's been a long time since I cofounded wikipedia, and I joined everipedia more recently
<p>I have a PhD in philosophy, specialising in the theory of knowledge. Knowledge is much harder than we think it is.
<p>We have taken care of the quantity problem of information - we can now answer any question in a few clicks, but the quality of the answer is not great
<p>I look at wikipedia and think we can do better - I see it as a missed opportunity. 
<p>we could have articles about every proper noun. We could rate articles. We could have multiple competing articles and have the ratings decide which was best
<p>for example, everipedia is open to everything. To prove this to myself I made an article about my left thumb
<p>one of the reasons more people aren't contributing to wikipedia is that it is hard to contribute - you need to learn a markup language
<p>What if we were to collect all the encyclopedia articles in the world and have people rate them I think it would be more interesting 
<p>We will build everipedia's IQ tokens on Eos, which launches in June. If you edit an article you will be mining tokens for yourself. This will mean you contribute to the governance of everipedia
<p>In phase 2, we want to bring other publishers onto everipedia's network - making the Greater Wiki possible - by putting the world's encyclopaedias on the blockchain, the content will have a chance to rise to the top

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.aunclicdelastic.com'>salvador anglada</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Dubai is a disruptive model, just as companies have disrupted industries
<p>Blockchain is only 10 years old, and it has not had any significant success, but ti comes with the promise of transparency
<p>The content creators have suffered so much on the internet because they could not control their copyrights
<p>at Etisalat we have been disrupted once, and we don't want it to happen again

<p>what we decided to do in Malta was to look at the technologies first, and once they are approved pass them on to the other regulators - we have looked at Distributed Ledger Technologies  first
<p>if they want to build financial systems on top of them, then they need to talk to the financial regualtors too.

What we are tyring to do is eliminate the wastage but keeping the regualtor intact wiht a view of the trusted system
<p>we need a neutral party to enforce a use case, and the regualtor can play that role
