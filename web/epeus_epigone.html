  <span class="p-name">Newspaper firms must face heavy fines over extremist content – MPs</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <h2 class="p-summary">An inquiry by the Commons home affairs committee condemns Newspaper companies for failing to tackle hate speech.</h2><p>Newspaper companies are putting profit before safety and should face fines of tens of millions of pounds for failing to remove extremist and hate crime material promptly from their websites, MPs have said. <p>The largest and richest Newspaper firms are “shamefully far” from taking action to tackle inciting and dangerous content, according to a report by the Commons home affairs committee. <p>The inquiry, launched last year following the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right gunman, concludes that Newspaper multinationals are more concerned with commercial risks than public protection. Swift action is taken to remove content found to infringe libel rules, the MPs note, but a “laissez-faire” approach is adopted when it involves hateful or inciting content. <p>Referring to The Daily Mail’s failure to prevent paid advertising from reputable companies appearing next to editorials posted by extremists, the committee’s report said: “One of the world’s largest companies has profited from hatred and has allowed itself to be a platform from which extremists have generated revenue.” <p>“Newspaper companies currently face almost no penalties for failing to remove inciting content,” the MPs conclude. “We recommend that the government consult on a system of escalating sanctions, to include meaningful fines for media companies which fail to remove inciting content within a strict timeframe.” <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iBwYsGg8Bgg/WQh6RBZR5hI/AAAAAAAAAJg/f9hGiFd39lg2mpMZi-O73a2EO2my6sKRgCLcB/s1600/mail.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iBwYsGg8Bgg/WQh6RBZR5hI/AAAAAAAAAJg/f9hGiFd39lg2mpMZi-O73a2EO2my6sKRgCLcB/s1600/mail.jpg" /></a></div><p>During its investigation, the committee found instances of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2520012/Send-home-In-shocking-video-UKIP-councillor-key-Farage-ally-launches-astonishing-racist-rant--tells-MoS-I-stand-word.html">racist recruitment videos for UKIP</a> remaining accessible online even after MPs had complained about them. <p>Some of the material included <a href="https://www.thejc.com/comment/comment/was-the-daily-mail-piece-antisemitic-1.49313">antisemitic attacks</a> on MPs that had been the subject of a previous committee report. Material encouraging child abuse and <a href="http://www.themediablog.co.uk/the-media-blog/2013/01/the-daily-mail-all-grown-up.html">sexual images of children</a> was also not removed, despite being reported on by journalists. <p>Newspaper companies that fail to proactively search for and remove such content should pay towards costs of the police doing so, the report recommends, just as football clubs are obliged to pay for policing in their stadiums and surrounding areas on match days. <p>Firms should publish regular reports on their safeguarding activity, including the number of staff involved, complaints and actions taken, the committee says. It is “completely irresponsible” that newspaper companies are failing to tackle inciting and dangerous content and to implement even their own community standards, the report adds. <p>While the principles of free speech and open public debate in democracy should be maintained, the report argues, it is essential that “some voices are not drowned out by harassment and persecution, by the promotion of violence against particular groups, or by terrorism and extremism”. <p>Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the home affairs committee, said: “Newspaper companies’ failure to deal with inciting and dangerous material online is a disgrace. <p>“They have been asked repeatedly to come up with better systems to remove inciting material such as terrorist recruitment or online child abuse. Yet repeatedly they have failed to do so. It is shameful. <p>“These are among the biggest, richest and cleverest companies in the world, and their services have become a crucial part of people’s lives. This isn’t beyond them to solve, yet they are failing to do so. They continue to operate as platforms for hatred and extremism without even taking basic steps to make sure they can quickly stop inciting material, properly enforce their own community standards, or keep people safe … <p>“It is blindingly obvious that they have a responsibility to proactively search their platforms for inciting content, particularly when it comes to racist organisations.” <p>Parody of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/01/social-media-firms-should-be-fined-for-extremist-content-say-mps-google-youtube-facebook">This Guardian article on MPs censuring social media firms</a>

  <span class="p-name">Mastodon, Twitter and publics</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Long ago, I <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.co.uk/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html">wrote about</a> the theory of social sites, with the then-young Twitter as the exemplar. As Mastodon, GnuSocial and other federated sites have <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-google/episodes/400">caught some attention</a> recently, I thought I'd revisit these theories.</p><h2>Flow</h2><p class="">A temporal flow with no unread count that you could dip into was freeing compared to the email-like experience of feed readers back then. Now this is commonplace and accepted. Twitter has backtracked from the pure flow by emphasising the unread count for @'s. GnuSocial replicates this, but Mastodon eschews it, and presents parallel flows to dip into.</p><h2>Faces</h2><p class="">Having a face next to each message is also commonplace - even LinkedIn has faces now. Some groups within the fediverse resist this and prefer stylised avatars. On twitter, logos are the faces of brands, and subverting the facial default is part of the appeal to older online forms that is latent in the fediverse.</p><h2>Phatic</h2><p class="">Twitter has lost a lot of its phatic feeling, but for now Mastodon and the others have that pleasant tone to a lot of posts that comes with sharing and reacting without looking over your shoulder. Partly this is the small group homophily, but as <a href="http://xn--rpa.cc/essays/infrastructure">Lexi says</a>:</p><blockquote>For many people in the SJ community, Mastodon became more than a social network — it was an introduction to the tools of the trade of the open source world. People who were used to writing interminable hotheaded rants about the appropriation of “daddy” were suddenly opening GitHub issues and participating in the development cycle of a site used by thousands. It was surreal, and from a distance, slightly endearing.</blockquote><p class="">Eugen has done a good job of tummling this community, listening to their concerns and tweaking Mastodon to reflect them. The way the Content Warning is used there is a good example of this - people are thinking about what others might find annoying (political rants, perhaps?) and tucking them away behind the little CW toggle.</p><p class="">The existential dread caused by Twitter’s reply all by default and culture of sealioning is not yet here.</p><h2>Following</h2><p class="">Part of the relative calm is due to a return of the following model - you choose whom to follow and it’s not expected to be mutual. However there are follow (and boost and like) notifications there if you want them, which contains the seeds of the twitter engagement spiral. This is mitigated to some extent by the nuances of the default publics that are constructed for you.</p><h2>Publics</h2><p class="">As with Twitter, and indeed the web in general, we all see a different subset of &nbsp;the conversation. We each have our own public that we see and address. These publics are semi-overlapping - they are connected, but adjacent. This is not Habermas’s public sphere, but de Certeau's distinction of place and space. The place is the structure provided, the space the life given it by the paths we take through it and our interactions.</p><p class="">Since I first wrote <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.co.uk/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html">Twitter Theory</a>, Twitter itself has become much more like a single public sphere, through its chasing of ‘engagement’ above all else. The federated nature of Mastodon, GnuSocial, &nbsp;the blogosphere and indeed the multiply-linked web is now seen as confusing by those used to Twitter's silo.</p><p class="">The structure of Mastodon and GnuSocial instances provides multiple visible publics by default, and Mastodon's columnar layout (on wider screens) emphasises this. You have your own public of those you follow, and the notifications sent back in response, as with Twitter. But you also have two more timeline choices - the Local and the Federated. These make the substructure manifest. Local is everyone else posting on your instance. The people who share a server with you are now a default peer group. The Federated public is even more confusing to those with a silo viewpoint. It shows all the posts that this instance has seen - GnuSocial calls it “the whole known network” - all those followed by you and others on your instance. This is not the whole fediverse, it’s still a window on part of it.&nbsp;</p><p class="">In a classic silo, who you share a server shard with is an implementation detail, but choosing an instance does define a neighbourhood for you. Choosing to join <a href="http://www.unmung.com/mastoview?url=witches.town&amp;view=local">witches.town</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://www.unmung.com/mastoview?url=awoo.space&amp;view=local">awoo.space</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://www.unmung.com/mastoview?url=botsin.space&amp;view=local">botsin.space</a>&nbsp;will give you a different experience from <a href="http://www.unmung.com/mastoview?url=mastodon.social&amp;view=local">mastodon.social</a></p><h2>Mutual Media</h2><p class="">By showing some of these subsets explicitly, the fediverse can help us understand the nature of mutual media a bit more. As <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.co.uk/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html#Mutual%20media">I said</a>:</p><blockquote>What shows up in Twitter, in blogs and in the other ways we are connecting the loosely coupled web into flows is that by each reading whom we choose to and passing on some of it to others, we are each others media, we are the synapses in the global brain of the web of thought and conversation. Although we each only touch a local part of it, ideas can travel a long way.&nbsp;</blockquote><p class="">The engagement feedback loops of silos such as Twitter and Facebook have amplified this flow. The furore over Fake News is really about the seizures caused by overactivity in these synapses - confabulation and hallucination in the global brain of mutual media. With popularity always following a power law, runaway memetic outbreaks can become endemic, especially when the platform is doing what it can to accelerate them without any sense of their context or meaning.</p><h2>Small World Networks</h2><p>It may be that the more concrete boundaries that having multiple instances provide can dampen down the cascades caused by the small world network effect. It is an interesting model to coexist between the silos with global scope and the personal domains beloved by the <a href="https://indieweb.org">indieweb</a>. In indieweb we have been saying ‘build things that you want for yourself’, but building things that you want for your friends or organisation is a useful step between <a href="https://indieweb.org/generations">generations</a>.</p><h2>Standards</h2><p class="">The other thing reinforced for me by this resurgence of OStatus-based conversation is my conviction that standards are documentation, not legislation. We have been working in the w3c Social Web Working Group to clarify and document newer, simpler protocols, but rough consensus and running code does define the worlds we see.</p>Originally published at <a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/mastodontheory.html">kevinmarks.com</a>

  <span class="p-name">Not in our Stars</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <h3>Brief summary for tweet length attention spans</h3>We can get back the much-mourned favorite star on twitter by an 'add a comment' retweet with a 🌟 emoji eg: <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">🌟 <a href="https://t.co/W9i12AfVBe">https://t.co/W9i12AfVBe</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Marks (@kevinmarks) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/662006580267773953">November 4, 2015</a></blockquote><h3>executive summary in bullet form</h3>This has the following advantages: <ul><li> Lets you use star again, or any other emoji that better expresses nuance. <li>Notifies the person starred, just as 'like' does <li>shows up in your feed (but not in your favorites list) <li>works in all twitter clients as it shows the emoji and link by default, and the linked-to tweet in official ones <li>can be liked and retweeted in its own right </ul>and some drawbacks: <ul><li>is not counted as a like or a retweet (this is true for all quoted tweets) <li>is a bit more obtrusive than the old favorite <li>takes more than one click to create </ul> <h3>Historical exegesis and discussion of semiotics</h3>Back in the dawn of twitter, new ways of using it were created by users, sporadically adopted, and then reified first by the vibrant client ecosystem, and eventually by official Twitter clients. Hashtags, @ replies and retweets started this way, as <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/microsyntax">microsyntax</a> or <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/picoformats">picoformats</a>. <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/favorites">Favorites</a> were added <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2006/six-more-twitter-updates">early on</a> and had a <a href="https://favstar.fm/">favstar</a>-like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070214000103/http://twitter.com/favourings/top10">top ten list</a> with the lovely url slug 'favourings'. Your favorites were always public, and obviously so (unlike <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/12/managing-your-shared-items.html">Google reader's</a> which scared users). But when they caused notifications and showed up in timelines as actions, people were <a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2014/08/17/twitters-latest-experiment-turns-favorites-into-retweets-and-its-annoying-lots-of-people/">disconcerted.</a> <p>The very opacity of the star meant that people could imbue it with its own meaning, and the nuances of what faving meant have been long-discussed - see <a href="http://time.com/4336/a-simple-guide-to-twitter-favs/">Jessica Roy in Time</a> for an example. Hence the immense hand-wringing over Twitter's change from star to heart and favorite to like. Perhaps they were led by <a href="https://t.co/9myR2rchh4">AirBnB's 30% engagement boost</a> when they made the change? The difference is one of semiotics though - when you apply a heart to a place to stay that is clearer than applying it to a tweet; it may still be a nuanced note on the host, or ironic, but the layers of meaning are more limited than in a tweet. With a tweet there are many more possible signifiers you may be indicating favour or attention to. Who saying it, who's @-tagged, hashtags, links, embedded media, the threads extending before or after, can all be grist for that little pointer. <p>However, there is another user-driven pattern that Twitter has not paid much attention to - emoji as replies. If you look through <a href="http://emojitracker.com/">emojitracker</a> there are nearly a billion uses of the 😂 emoji and over a billion of the various hearts. This is a way people use to express the missing nuance that a single system-chosen glyph doesn't convey. Now you can reply to people with this directly, but that doesn't have the right effect; it is directly responding to the person, not the tweet, and relying on twitter threading to handle it. <p>Twitter's new 'quote tweet' option, hidden under the retweet button, gives a better way: <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">🌟 <a href="https://t.co/luxejFZHod">https://t.co/luxejFZHod</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Marks (@kevinmarks) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/661640979066163201">November 3, 2015</a></blockquote><p>Shown in twitter with the quoted tweet inlined: <p><img src="http://www.kevinmarks.com/starfav.png" /><p>Shown in classic clients as a star and a link. This is a public post, clear in intent, and directed at the tweet with its associated media and nuance, just as a favorite was. <p>There is more flexibility here - repeated emoji; multiple emoji <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">☑ ✅ 💯 <a href="https://t.co/GRBaxlsKHB">https://t.co/GRBaxlsKHB</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Marks (@kevinmarks) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/661936856787869696">November 4, 2015</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep">@zeynep</a> Maybe Twitter should add a checkmark -- ✔-- to signal things like &quot;noted&quot; and &quot;save for later&quot; etc. Keep the heart for &quot;likes&quot; etc.</p>&mdash; Dan Gillmor (@dangillmor) <a href="https://twitter.com/dangillmor/status/661667577161093120">November 3, 2015</a></blockquote><p>In fact, had twitter thought this through they could have saved time on the disappointing new "polls" feature by emulating <a href="https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206870317-Emoji-reactions">Slack's 'reacji' voting </a> instead. <p>In the meantime, join me and the billions of other emoji tweeters in using a star reply to indicate your favoring. <a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/notinourstars.html">originally published on kevinmarks.com</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

First he complains about hyphenation and ligatures. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens">Hyphens</a> are in <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#hyphens-property">CSS Text Level 3</a> and are implemented in <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=hyphens">many browsers</a> though not yet Chrome. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant-ligatures">Ligatures</a> are in <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-3/#propdef-font-variant-ligatures">CSS Fonts Level 3</a> and supported in <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=font-variant-ligature">many browsers too</a> — Apple has done it for years. Here we have the T<sub>E</sub>Χ example, live rendering from your browser, and what Safari Mac made of it. Note the hyphenation and the ligatures. Also, I took out the spaces around the em-dashes that Lee Phillips oddly put in. <style>.mobydick { -webkit-hyphens: auto; -moz-hyphens: auto; -ms-hyphens: auto; hyphens: auto; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; -webkit-font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; font-family:"Hoefler Text", Georgia, Palatino, serif; text-align: justify; width: 17.5em; max-width: 17.5em; line-height: 1.2em; border: white solid .75em; } .textexamples {display:flex;-webkit-display:flex;flex-wrap: wrap; -webkit-flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around; -webkit-justify-content: space-around; max-width:100vh;} </style><div class="textexamples"><div class="mobydick"><img src="http://www.kevinmarks.com/10-tex-mobytex.png" width=100% /></div><div class="mobydick">Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.</div><div class="mobydick"><img src="http://www.kevinmarks.com/safarihyphen.png" width=100% /></div></div><p>Next Phillips takes on mathematical equations. His first example is e<sup>iπ</sup> = −1. Note how that was displayed fine inline, just by using <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>, which has been in HTML for years, along with <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> which I used to show the T<sub>E</sub>Χ e. <p>Phillips is right that doing more complex equation layout in pure HTML is difficult. Fortunately, we do have SVG for arbitrarily precise positioning of text and graphics. I took his example of Stokes equation, and put it through <a href="http://www.tlhiv.org/ltxpreview/">Troy Henderson's LaTeX Previewer</a> (which I found by googling 'tex to svg'). Here we are: <div id = 'top'>Top</div><p>Here is the elementary version of Stokes' Theorem: <p><img src="http://www.kevinmarks.com/stokes.svg" /><p><a href="#top">Go to top</a><p>Now, the SVG there, though scalable, is not ideal - it renders as paths, not characters. If I use SVG text, I can get it selectable: <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="200" height="40" ><text x="0" y="27" style="line-height:125%; font-size:18px; font-family:Serif;"> <tspan style="font-size:36px;">∫</tspan><tspan style="font-size:12px;" baseline-shift="sub">𝝨</tspan>∇×𝐅∙𝑑𝝨 = <tspan style="font-size:36px;">∮</tspan><tspan style="font-size:12px;" baseline-shift="sub" dx="-10px">∂𝝨</tspan> 𝐅∙𝑑𝐫 </text></svg><p>Here's the SVG code for that. You can see the tighter control. <code><pre>&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="200" height="40" &gt;<br />&lt;text x="0" y="27" style="line-height:125%; font-size:18px; font-family:Serif;"&gt;<br /> &lt;tspan style="font-size:36px;"&gt;∫&lt;/tspan&gt;<br /> &lt;tspan style="font-size:12px;" baseline-shift="sub"&gt;𝝨&lt;/tspan&gt;<br /> ∇×𝐅∙𝑑𝝨 = &lt;tspan style="font-size:36px;"&gt;∮&lt;/tspan&gt;<br /> &lt;tspan style="font-size:12px;" baseline-shift="sub" dx="-10px"&gt;∂𝝨&lt;/tspan&gt; 𝐅∙𝑑𝐫<br />&lt;/text&gt;<br />&lt;/svg&gt;</pre></code><p>However, you may not see all the glyphs, as I am using the special unicode characters for Mathematical letters, and your browser or device may not have those. Here's a version with ordinary latin and greek letters: <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="200" height="40" ><text x="0" y="27" style="line-height:125%; font-size:18px; font-family:Serif;"> <tspan style="font-size:36px;">∫</tspan><tspan style="font-size:12px;" baseline-shift="sub">Σ</tspan>∇×F∙dΣ = <tspan style="font-size:36px;">∮</tspan><tspan style="font-size:12px;" baseline-shift="sub" dx="-10px">∂Σ</tspan> F∙dr </text></svg><p>Phillips may be superficially right that HTML doesn't give as much typographic control as T<sub>E</sub>Χ, but when you compare to the full web suite, including CSS and SVG, that conclusion can't be sustained; indeed even his point about macros could be solved by using javascript as well, though I prefer my web pages to be declarative. <p>That said, many of the CSS specs I have linked to are still being edited, so this is a good time to try out authoring your mathematical papers that way and possibly proposing changes.

  <h4>a response to Anil Dash's <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2013/04/i-like-blogging-software.html">I Like Blogging Software</a></h4><p>Recently on Twitter Anil Dash and I had a bit of a back and forth: <blockquote class="twitter-tweet h-cite" lang="en" data-conversation="none"><p class="e-content">Hi, it&#39;s been two years, will somebody go build this set of tools and go make millions of dollars please? <a href="http://t.co/jLX0Dp5DxI">http://t.co/jLX0Dp5DxI</a></p>&mdash; Anil Dash Dot Com (@anildash) <a class="u-url" href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/555408559450906624">January 14, 2015</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet h-cite" lang="en" data-conversation="none"><p class="e-content"><a href="https://twitter.com/anildash">@anildash</a> all that&#39;s been shipped as <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/indieweb?src=hash">#indieweb</a> tools, except we use html instead of json because web.

From a potential customer. Listening is a good strategy. Berating, less so.</p>&mdash; Marco Rogers (@polotek) <a class="u-url" href="https://twitter.com/polotek/status/555420768423522306">January 14, 2015</a></blockquote>This is a fair point, and so here is a post going into more detail. <p>The quoted parts are from <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2013/04/i-like-blogging-software.html">Anil's blog post</a> - I'll respond inline: <blockquote class="h-cite"><p>So, my contribution is to collect some of the notes I've been gathering for the last few years about what I'd like to see in a blogging tool. I know there are apps with many, perhaps even all, of these features, but I'd like to see <b>one</b> emerge as a leading platform for doing innovative work. </blockquote>(emphasis added) <p>Here Anil is explicitly calling out for a <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/monoculture">monoculture</a>, rather than a set of interoperable tools and protocols. As Anil mentions, he used to work at Six Apart, which built <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/site-deaths#Vox+shut">several</a> <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/site-deaths#Pownce.com">blogging</a> tools in that way, each hoping to be the one. Indeed seeing the success of <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/silos">silos</a>, their monolithic nature can be seen as contributing to this; their widespread adoption coming from focusing on innovating and improving user experience rather than interoperability with others.<p>With indieweb we are trying a different approach by working through our own <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/itches">wishlists</a>, reusing common components, and making sure we interoperate along the way. This gives us a composable set of tools that do plug together - the toolkit Anil both is and isn't asking for. <blockquote class="h-cite"><p>My blogging features wishlist:</p> <ul><li>I enter markdown in plain text files; these are stored on Dropbox/Google Drive/Skydrive and/or S3 and/or GitHub.</li><li>The system renders those plain files into <span class="caps">JSON </span>assets in a documented format.</li></ul></blockquote><p>There are lots of indieweb tools that work in this kind of way; but Anil is very focused on the specifics of formats. <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/Markdown">Markdown</a> is one popular way of writing text for posts; indeed many indieweb tools support it. <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/JSON">JSON</a> is handy as an interchange format between programming languages, but as Anil says, having a documented common format is useful. What we realised working on indieweb is thet we already have a lingua franca for webpages and blogs, and that is HTML. Ultimately all sites publish in this format, so using that and adjusting it minimally to make interop easier is the approach we took. <p>Our documented format is <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats-2">Microformats 2</a>, which for blog posts involves h-entry and h-feed as common structure, with additional microformats to label other reusable features. Generating HTML from Markdown is relatively straightforward, if <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/">not always deterministic</a>, as that was its design goal. Generating JSON from HTML formatted with <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/microformats2">microformats 2</a> is also <a href="http://pin13.net/mf2/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kevinmarks.com%2Fwe-like-indieweb-software.html">straightforward</a> and <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/validators">more deterministic</a>. <p>Storing source files in various cloud services is practical and indeed done by many indieweb tools, but requiring a specific cloud service's file system is less flexible and general than using HTML on the web itself, so that's what we do. <blockquote class="h-cite"><ul><li>A Bootstrap-themed reading client app lives at my site, on my domain, and reads a single simple config file to learn how to display and navigate between those <span class="caps">JSON </span>assets. This client app would also have to handle <span class="caps">URL </span>routing and persisting states, while ideally also keeping preferences and reading history for readers.</li><li>The default theme offers a YouTube-style browsing view of all my content, where people can make playlists of posts (this is equivalent to navigating my archives by tag), embed my posts on their own sites, and easily explore by traditional groupings like category or date.</li></ul></blockquote><p>This is a lot of fragility - the default Blogger template switched to a JSON model like this and consequently fails to render a lot of the time. Twitter too used an all-JSON web app for a while, before reverting to HTML+json enhancements. The fragility comes from JSON being much less resilient to encoding or writing errors than HTML - HTML5 specifies how to consistently handle even invalid or poorly marked-up HTML pages, whereas with JSON you will get a parse error and lose the whole page, <a href="http://htmlcssjavascript.com/web/youre-so-smart-you-turned-javascript-into-xhtml/">just like XML</a>. By using HTML instead for your format, the page can be read on every platform by default. Now, behind the scenes JSON can be useful - indeed Known uses a JSON store for its posts database, but exposing this publicly will likely lead to incompatibility over time. <p>We are beginning to see indieweb <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/reader">reader</a> apps that work by parsing the h-feed and h-entry markup published, and give the remixability that Anil mentions, but they are an augmentation to the basic page, not a required path along the way. <blockquote class="h-cite"><p><ul><li>There might be an optional administration interface separate for me, just for editing the markdown files through a plain text in-browser editor; In this case, it should be a responsive app that works in all my browsers.</li></ul></blockquote><p>On the indieweb, this is handled by two protocols: Micropub and IndieAuth. <p><a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/indieauth">IndieAuth</a> lets you prove that you are the owner of the site by logging in, so you can get editing privileges or other enhanced versions. <p><a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/micropub">Micropub</a> is a simple protocol, based on HTML forms, to let you edit and publish posts and notes. By using these two it is possible to have multiple different tools to create and edit posts, independent of the mechanics of their storage, as they also use HTML for interchange. <blockquote class="h-cite"><p><ul><li>Ideally comments are handled as small messages in a documented json format, sent between instances of this blogging application. Of course in the short term I would just embed Disqus/Facebook/Google-style comments until that infrastructure was further along.</li></ul></blockquote><p>For <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/comments">comments</a> we use the same documented HTML format, but add the idea of a <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention">webmention</a>. This is a simple protocol that enables you to send a link to your post or comment that responds to (mentions) another post. The webmention receiver can parse this, check it does indeed link to it, and interpret it as a comment, a <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/reply">reply</a>, a <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/repost">repost</a>, a <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/like">like</a> or an <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/RSVP">RSVP</a> depending on the microformats markup used. <blockquote class="h-cite"><p><ul><li>Having a documented format for the json objects which represent posts and comments would permit transclusion and sending of posts between sites, in a manner analogous to how <a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo</a> does this for outliners, and in a way that would bring back some of the positives of TrackBack in the early blogosphere.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Exactly! Webmention does this, but with verification and context, which means that it can be used for reposting, but also for threaded comments, per-paragraph <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/annotations">annotations</a> and other things we haven't thought of yet. <blockquote class="h-cite"><p><ul><li>"Themes" would largely be implemented as Bootstrap <span class="caps">CSS </span>stylesheets, with some affordance for separate content modules. By default, themes are public so I would just be able to tell an admin app to import a theme from your site so I could remix it.</li></ul></blockquote><p>By using HTML as the source interchange format, styling can be done by CSS directly; also it is relatively easy to process and parse HTML and inject it into a site - see the <a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/we-like-indieweb-software.html#responses">webmentions</a> on my website that are <a href="https://webmention.herokuapp.com/">added by an indieweb service</a>. <blockquote class="h-cite"><p><ul><li>The <span class="caps">API </span>endpoint for discovering the json representations of content would double as the <span class="caps">API </span>for others to access my data to build around it; Eventually a posting app which saved <span class="caps">POST</span>s of that json format as fiels in dropbox would allow a write <span class="caps">API.</</li></ul></blockquote><p>The webpage itself is the HTML representation of the content; you get the json version by parsing that, using existing parsers - for example: <p>A posting app can look for the micropub endpoint in the page and the indieauth endpoint and work with that, as tools like <a href="https://quill.p3k.io/">Quill</a>, <a href="http://ownyourgram.com/">ownyourgram</a> and <a href="https://ben.thatmustbe.me/new">Postly</a> do now. <blockquote class="h-cite"><p>I think that's it for now. Let me know if somebody's got all these boxes checked on their platform today, but I suspect the hardest part is the client app for readers, which works in a way analogous to an <span class="caps">RSS </span>reader or email client, but would have to support a new format and would be optimized for clean reading and subsequent discovery, rather than the three-pane model which has dominated those apps for the last decade or two.</p></blockquote><p>Anil's assumption that the reader app is harder is <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/Shrewdness">shrewd</a>, though it has also been less necessary as the browser enables reading of pages in any case. Indieweb readers are being built now with varying UI based on these underlying protocols, so we should have all the pieces soon. <p>The closest thing to a single platform that supports this is <a href="http://withknown.com">Known</a>, an open source indieweb-<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/friendly">friendly</a> blogging tool that can be installed on your own site or hosted by Known for you. <p>There's even a <a href="https://withknown.com/pro/"> Pro version of Known</a> if you want to help make <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/555408559450906624">Anil's prediction</a> come true. <p>If these indieweb ideas sound interesting, come along to the next <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/events/next-hwc">Homebrew Website Club</a>, or <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/today?beta#bottom">join us in IRC.</a><p><a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/we-like-indieweb-software.html" rel="canonical" class="u-syndication">Originally on my own website</a><br><a href="http://news.indiewebcamp.com/post/www.kevinmarks.com/we-like-indieweb-software.html" class="u-syndication">also on IndieNews</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

  <span class="p-name">How did Twitter become the hate speech wing of the free speech party?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Twitter has changed. When it started out it was a haven from the <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/281604942295355392" target="_blank">unread count</a> in your email inbox, from the tension of blogging and <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/09/tummling-sidewiki-twitter-and-tragedy.html" target="_blank">comments</a>. You didn't have to write long form essays, you didn't have to moderate commenters. You didn't have to make all those bold lines go away to reach inbox zero. You just followed some people and typed thoughts that occurred to you. Those who followed you got texted them, or sent them in IM. Simple. <p> Then, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510141227/http%3A%2F%2Fanarchogeek.com/2012/07/09/origin-of-the-reply-digging-through-twitters-history/" target="_blank">we came up with @ replies</a>. They were a way of making it clear who you were responding to. Twitter sensibly adopted them, but they were off to one side. You had to click on the @ tab to see them. Your primary experience was still the people who you followed, which you controlled. I wrote about <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html" target="_blank">Twitter theory</a> with this in mind. <p> Twitter created permeable, <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html" target="_blank">overlapping publics</a>, and championed free speech and anonymity. They <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/22/twitter-tony-wang-free-speech" target="_blank">said</a> they were the "free speech wing of the free speech party". <p> Twitter reinforced this by hiding tweets that start with an @ unless you followed the person being talked to. This reduced serendipitous friend discovery, but also damped down arguments. (You can still see this in <a href="https://analytics.twitter.com" target="_blank">twitter analytics</a>: note the difference in reach versus engagement for posts versus replies). <p> However, Twitter had a <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130913/does-twitter-have-a-growth-problem/" target="_blank">perceived problem</a> - this very contained, comfortable nature meant that it took effort to get started and find people to follow. They worked really hard at changing this, building a <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110330/making-sign-ups-more-complicated-is-a-good-thing-and-other-lessons-from-twitters-user-retention-efforts/" target="_blank">sign up process </a>that made it very hard not to follow lots of people, <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/176907091583006681/" target="_blank">especially famous ones</a>. Also, they changed the way we got notified. <p> Emails and app notifications of new followers and @ replies were set up to drive engagement, encouraging you to return. &nbsp;That @ tab got an unread count on it, just like the email inbox, and the app got a red number on it on iPhones. <p> The problem with this is that responses do not follow a smooth distribution. Sure, most tweets get no responses, but some take off. Hashtags became another way to spread tweets sideways, beyond the follow graph. <p> Twitter saw this as increased engagement, and most of the time it was good. They built special tools in for "verified" users—the celebrities and brands they used to woo the rest of us with on sign up. The Verified get to damp down the notification flood, or just see other verified people. <p> The problem is that by making @ replies the most visible part of the app, they'd brought us back to email and blog comments again. <p> Your tweet could win the fame lottery, and everyone on the Internet who <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/" target="_blank">thinks you are wrong</a> could tell you about it. Or one of the "verified" could <a href="https://twitter.com/freebsdgirl/status/517586520812052480" target="_blank">call you out to be the tribute</a> for your community and fight in their Hunger Games. <p> Say something about feminism or race, or <a href="http://wondermark.com/1k62/" target="_blank">sea lions</a> and you'd find yourself inundated by the same trite responses from multitudes. Complain about it, and they turn nasty, abusing you, calling in their friends to join in. Your <a href="https://twitter.com/freebsdgirl/status/518139158158536704" target="_blank">phone becomes useless</a> under the weight of notifications; you can't see your friends support amongst <a href="https://twitter.com/freebsdgirl/status/518139287787671552" target="_blank">the flood</a>. <p> Twitter has become the <a href="http://users.humboldt.edu/mstephens/hate/hate_map.html" target="_blank">hate speech</a> wing of the free speech party. <p> The limited tools available - blocking, muting, going private - do not match well with these floods. Twitter's abuse reporting form <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/08/12/twitterfail-twitters-refusal-handle-online-stalkers-abusers-haters/" target="_blank">takes far longer than a tweet</a>, and is explicitly ignored if friends try to help. <p> This is where we are now. There are new attempts to remake following-focused semi-permeable publics. <a href="http://withknown.com" target="_blank">Known</a>, <a href="http://ello.co" target="_blank">ello</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/collectqt/quirell/issues" target="_blank">Quirell</a> are some. In the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com" target="_blank">indieweb</a> world we are just starting to connect sites together with <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention" target="_blank">webmentions</a>, and we need to consider this history as we do. <p><a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/twitterhatespeech.html" rel="syndication" class="u-syndication" >Also published on my own site</a><p><a href="http://known.kevinmarks.com/2014/how-did-twitter-become-the-hate-speech-wing-of-the" rel="syndication" class="u-syndication" >Also published on Known</a><p><a href="https://ello.co/kevinmarks/post/rTuwTncTfWlqi1kxcxxt_g" rel="syndication" class="u-syndication" >Also published on ello</a><p><a href="https://medium.com/@kevinmarks/how-did-twitter-become-the-hate-speech-wing-of-the-free-speech-party-17e4c3ca489c" rel="syndication" class="u-syndication" >Also published on Medium</a>

  <span class="p-name">Fragmentions for Poets</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Since the original fragmention <a href="https://github.com/chapmanu/fragmentions">implementation</a> and <a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html">discussion</a>, we've been trying it out in various contexts, including <a href="https://christiaanconover.com/code/wp-fragmention##any+text">any wordpress blog</a>, Shakespeare's <a href="http://shakespeare.sayit.mysociety.org/much-ado-about-nothing/act-iv/scene-i-a-church##link+my+dear+friend">complete works</a> and <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/fragmention##this+wiki">even the indiewebcamp wiki</a>. Also there have been a lot of reactions and suggestions. Some of these occur often enough that I thought I'd write some responses down. <h3>What if the linked-to text changes?</h3><p>Several people pointed to the New York Times <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/emphasis-update-and-source/">Emphasis</a> project, which builds IDs from initial letters of sentences in a paragraph to provide some degree of resilience against the linked-to text being changed. It also tries using edit distances if it can't find the text. <p>Whether you still want to link to changed text is a tricky problem - if it has completely been removed, then the annotation or point of linking may have gone (pointing out a typo, or misstatement). Even a small change (adding the word 'not' for example) can mean that the point of linking has changed, so my first thought is that changing the text breaking the link can be reasonable. <p>If you want some fuzzy matching to go on, having more of the linked-to text in the fragment can only help the linked-to page identify where in the text was intended. Indeed, if enough is included, you could show the difference between what was linked to and what is there now. <h3>What if the linked-to text occurs more than once?</h3><p>By default, go to the first instance. If you want a different link, use more words to create a unique reference. While there have been proposals to <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-04-22/line/1398233800">link to the nth occurrence</a> using more <a href="http://www.gerv.net/software/fragment-search/">complex syntax</a>, I don't think this is actually a natural choice, and likely to be more fragile. The NYT Emphasis tool mentioned above switched from a nth sentence type model to a content dependent one for this reason; fragmentions simplify and extend this idea. <p>I have tried to come up with a use case that fits this goal - the closest I can think of is referring to a particular repetition of a line of poetry, for example in a villanelle. <p> I can link to <a href="##rage+against+the+dying+of+the+light">the 3rd line of the 1st verse</a> by citing it in full. If I wanted the final line, linking to <a href="##Do+not+go+gentle+into+that+good+night.+Rage,+rage+against+the+dying+of+the+light.">it and the line before</a> would work. I think this is clear, though linking to <a href="##night.+Rage">night & Rage</a> would be enough. <p>The only reason I can think of to link to specific lines would be to discuss them in the context of surrounding lines, so I think this works adequately. <p>If a tool is made to allow readers to construct a link to a specific phrase, indicating that that phrase is not unique to encourage them to choose a longer phrase may be worth it. <h3>Could you combine an id and a fragmention?</h3><p>A link of form #id##some+words has been suggested, but again I'm not sure I see the utility. This is the nth occurrence idea in a different guise. It combines two addressing models in one, making it harder to construct and more fragile to resolve. <h3>Can we get rid of ## and just use #?</h3><p>The other thought, based on closer reading of the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#the-id-attribute">HTML5 spec ID attribute</a>: <blockquote><p>The <code>id</code> attribute specifies its element's unique identifier (ID). [DOM] <p>The value must be unique amongst all the IDs in the element's home subtree and must contain at least one character. The value must not contain any space characters. <p>There are no other restrictions on what form an ID can take; in particular, IDs can consist of just digits, start with a digit, start with an underscore, consist of just punctuation, etc </blockquote>is that we may not need the ## (which technically makes an invalid URL) at all. <p>If an HTML5 <code>id</code> cannot contain a space, then a fragment that contains one like <code>#two+word</code>s can never match an <code>id</code> (as <code>id="two words"</code> would be invalid). If it can't be an <code>id</code> it should be treated as a fragmention. <p>If you really want a one-word fragmention a trailing space like <code>#word+</code> could be used. <p>This means that the idea of fragmention could be simplified: if a fragment contains a space it MUST be a fragmention, and should be searched for in the text. If it doesn't match any IDs in the page, it COULD be a fragmention and should be searched for in the text anyway. <p>Fragmentions become a fallback to be used when an id can't be found. <h2>Do not go gentle into that good night</h2><p>Do not go gentle into that good night, <br>Old age should burn and rave at close of day; <br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right, <br>Because their words had forked no lightning they <br>Do not go gentle into that good night. <p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright <br>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, <br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, <br>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, <br>Do not go gentle into that good night. <p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight <br>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, <br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <p>And you, my father, there on the sad height, <br>Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. <br>Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <p> by Dylan Thomas <p><a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15377">hear him read it</a> <p><a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/poemfragmentions.html" rel="canonical">Originally on my own website</a>

  <span class="p-name">Fragmentions - linking to any text</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>A couple of weeks ago, I went to a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2014/04/annotation/">w3c workshop</a> about annotations on the web. It was an interesting day, hearing from academics, implementers, archivists and publishers about the ways they want to annotate things on the web, in the world, and in libraries. The more I listened, the more I realised that this was what the web is about. Each page that links to another one is an annotation on it. <p>Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the URL was a brilliant generalisation that means we can refer to anything, anywhere. But it has had a few problems over time. The original "<a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/w3cannotation.html##cool+URLs">Cool URLs don't change</a>" has given way to Tim's "eventually every URL ends up as a porn site". <p>Instead of using URLs, Google's huge success means that searching for text can be more robust than linking. If I want to point you to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22If+you+get+the+right+ones+in+the+right+order%22">Tom Stoppard's quote</a> from The Real Thing: <blockquote><p>I don’t think writers are sacred, but words are. They deserve respect. If you get the right ones in the right order, you can nudge the world a little or make a poem which children will speak for you when you’re dead.</p></blockquote> the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22If+you+get+the+right+ones+in+the+right+order%22">search link</a> is more resilient than linking to Mark Pilgrim's deleted post about it, which I <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2010/09/if-google-predicts-your-future-will-it.html##the+right+ones+in+the+right+order">linked to in 2011</a>. <p>Another problem is that linking in HTML is defined to address pages as a whole, or fragments within them, but only if the fragments are marked up as an id on an element. I can link to <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_02_01_archive.html#post-body-90336631">a blog post within a page</a> by using the link: <p><code>http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_02_01_archive.html#post-body-90336631</code><p>because the page contains markup: <p><code>&lt;div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-90336631" &gt;</code><p>But to do that I had to go and inspect the HTML and find the id, and make a link specially, by hand. <p>What if instead we combined these two ideas: <ul><li>use a fragment to identify part of a page</li><li>mention words in the page as the identifier</li></ul><p>I've named these "fragmentions" <p>To tell these apart from an id link, I suggest using a double hash - ## for the fragment, and then words that identify the text. For example: <p><code><a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_02_01_archive.html##annotate+the+web">http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_02_01_archive.html##annotate+the+web</a></code> <p>means "go to that page and find the words 'annotate the web' and scroll to show them" <p>If you click the link, you'll see that it works. That's because when I mentioned this idea <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-04-16/line/1397696273">in the indiewebcamp IRC channel</a>, <a href="http://www.jonathantneal.com/">Jonathan Neal</a> wrote a <a href="https://github.com/chapmanu/fragmentions">script</a> to implement this, and I added it to <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com">my blog</a> and to <a href="http://kevinmarks.com" >kevinmarks.com</a>. You can add it to your site too. <p>However, we can't get every site to add this script. So, Jonathan also made a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fragmentions/pgajkeekgcmgglngchhmcmnkffnhihck">Chrome Extension</a> so that these links will work on any site if you're running Chrome. (They degrade safely to linking to the page on other browsers). <p>So, try it out. Contribute to the discussion on the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/fragmention##Challenges">Indiewebcamp Fragmentions page</a>, or annotate this page by linking to it with a fragmention from your own blog or website. <p>Maybe we can persuade browser writers that fragmentions should be included everywhere. <p>Originally <a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html" rel="canonical" >posted</a> on kevinmarks.com

  <span class="p-name">How Apple's iOS fragmentation problems distort design thinking</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>As someone who uses both Android and iOS regularly, I'm getting increasingly frustrated by fragmentation. However it's not on my Android devices I see this, but on the iOS ones. I install a popular, well-funded application like Instagram, Flickr, or Circa on my iPad, but when I launch it 3/4 of the screen is black bars, with a teensy little app in the middle. Or I can choose to scale it up without smoothing, so jagged pixels I have't seen since the 1990s reinforce the sense that I am doing something wrong by attempting to run this app here. Every affordance is pushing back at me, saying I'm doing it wrong. <p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t_NM0Qvy0og/Ubj_2Xfjf4I/AAAAAAAAAFU/RssCYTh0ec8/s1600/nexusvipad.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t_NM0Qvy0og/Ubj_2Xfjf4I/AAAAAAAAAFU/RssCYTh0ec8/s400/nexusvipad.png" alt="on Android Nexus 7 Instagram looks great, on iPad it looks like a Victorian death notice" /></a></div><p>By contrast, on Android applications scale up to fill the space sensibly - buttons stay button sized, text and image areas expand well. Developers can add alternative layouts to better handle varying sizes, but if they don't things remain legible and touchable. <h3>One hand or on your knees?</h3><p>More pernicious is the artificial dichotomy that the iOS world leads our design thinking into. You're either on the held-in-one-hand phone, briefly standing somewhere, or you're sitting down in the evening using your iPad (so big and heavy that you have to rest it <a href="http://www.ipadkneesup.com">on your knees</a> - Steve Jobs even brought out a sofa to sit on at the launch). This false 'mobile versus desktop' dichotomy even misled <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-ipads-not-mobile-2010-11">Mark Zuckerberg</a> when he said "iPad's not mobile, it's a computer." and at the Facebook Home Launch, a tablet version was said to be "months away", though a working version was <a href="http://www.modaco.com/topic/361924-facebook-home-download-including-patched-apk-version/#entry2113130">hacked together by outside programmers</a> within days. <p>Meanwhile, nobody told Barnes and Noble, whose 7" Nook did so well that Amazon launched a Kindle range the same size, leading to the lovely Nexus 7 from Google and finally to the iPad Mini from Apple. This is the form factor, tested for years by paperback books, that makes one-handed long form reading comfortable. If you spend any time on public transit, being able to read standing up or in narrow bus seats is an obvious benefit. But the hermetically sealed company-coach commuters at Apple missed this for years. <p>Steve Jobs even said you'd have to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/18/steve-jobs-no-small-ipad/">file down your fingers to use it</a>. The thing is, on iOS it does feel like that. The iPad sized apps have too-small buttons, the iPhone ones are too big if zoomed. There is no way for an app to know how big your finger is compared to the screen, let alone a website. <p>The supposed advantage of iOS is fewer sizes to design for, but now you need 12 different layouts to cope with the horizontal and vertical orientations of each device, and the general layout tools don't handle this as well as Android, requiring <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/08/pixels">complex updates</a>. <a href="http://blog.sqisland.com/2013/02/learning-ios-as-android-developer.html">Chiu-Ki Chan explains the pain</a>, whereas <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/15/google-launches-android-studio-a-development-tool-for-apps/">Android Studio just made this even easier</a> for developers. <h3>No App is an island</h3> <p>The other fragmentation problem on iOS are the missing links. Not in the evolutionary sense, but the ability to readily connect between applications using URLs, as we're used to on the web. Applications can't claim parts of a URL, only <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/AdvancedAppTricks/AdvancedAppTricks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH7-SW18">a whole scheme.</a> As Apple says:<blockquote><p>If more than one third-party app registers to handle the same URL scheme, there is currently no process for determining which app will be given that scheme.</blockquote><p>On Android, any app can <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html#ifs">claim any scheme, host and path</a>, and the OS will resolve as appropriate, giving you a choice if more than one possibility is available. <p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-phjIj2XJ5Vk/UbkAQiEfjwI/AAAAAAAAAFY/8Gzo2Q-KmCQ/s1600/intent.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-phjIj2XJ5Vk/UbkAQiEfjwI/AAAAAAAAAFY/8Gzo2Q-KmCQ/s320/intent.png" alt="On Android, you get a choice for links, if there is one."/></a></div><p>On iOS, each app ends up embedding webviews inside it rather than linking to a browser, fragmenting your web history. I have to remember whether I got to the page via Twitter, or Facebook or email to go back to it later on, and I only get to share it to the iOS-approved places, Twitter, Facebook, email or iMessage. On Android, any installed app that can handle that type of media is an option to share to, or create a photo, make a phonecall, any of hundreds of "intents" that act as bridges between apps and, through browsers, the web. <p>This means that Android apps don't end up doing everything, but hand off to each other as needed, meaning that you can replace any function cleanly across apps. Better keyboards are the obvious example here, but camera apps, browsers, and SMS apps can drop themselves in, with the choice made by the user. <p>On iOS, you have to explicitly link to the scheme, which is per-app. Ironically, this means that Google (or Facebook) can release a set of iOS apps that connect to each other preferentially, leaving the Apple applications out of the loop. But it also makes it harder for developers to specialise in doing one thing well and linking to the rest. <h3>What of the Web?</h3><p>The other pernicious influence of iOS fragmentation has been the rise of the mobile-only site - the m. layout that was tuned for iPhone use, then slightly adapted for other mobile users, often giving rise to farcical single column layouts with huge whitespace on tablets. In the early iOS days this was a bonus, as it encouraged function-first design, without the organisation-chart-inspired cruft around the edges that websites accumulate over time. As the effective resolution of mobile devices has increased, now often exceeding what is available on desktops, the assumptions that drove mobile-specific sites are breaking down. <p>Now that <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kleinerperkins/2012-kpcb-internet-trends-yearend-update/24">Android is the dominant operating system</a>, Google is getting serious about it as a web platform too, which is very welcome. The Android Browser was installed as part of the OS, and didn't get upgraded over time. This has changed, with Chrome now the default Android browser, and it is on a regular update pipeline like Desktop Chrome and Firefox. iOS's Safari updates are frequent too now, and Microsoft is now <a href="http://www.modern.ie/en-us/cross-browser-best-practices">pleading with developers to give them modern web apps too</a>. <p>Truly <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">responsive design has succeeded mobile-first</a> as the best choice for websites, and we're seeing this spread as browsers converge on HTML5 features. What this means is that the web platform is now evolving rapidly, without any one browser provider being a bottleneck. The <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg">installed base for SVG</a> passed Flash a while back, and even <a href="http://html.adobe.com/webplatform">Adobe is now backing the web fully</a>, bringing their design know-how to HTML5 features such as <a href="http://html.adobe.com/webplatform/layout/regions/">regions</a> and <a href="http://html.adobe.com/webplatform/layout/exclusions/">exclusions</a>. Also in the pipeline for HTML5 is browser to browser audio, video and text chat via WebRTC. <h3>Hoping Apple continues the revolution</h3><p>This web platform revolution was catalysed by Apple with WebKit and Mozilla with Firefox, and picked up by Google, Microsoft, Adobe and others. We now have a Browser Battle to be more standards compliant and consistent, rather than a Browser War to be different and proprietary. What I'll be hoping for from Apple at next weeks WWDC is a clear recognition of these design lacunae and new and better ways for developers to succeed both with native apps and on the web. <p>This was also published on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/09/how-apples-ios-fragmentation-problems-distort-design-thinking/" rel="alternate">TechCrunch</a>.

  <span class="p-name">Finally, some progress in video codecs.</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>An announcement on Friday via <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2013/05/today-i-saw-the-future">Brendan Eich</a>: <blockquote>ORBX.js, a downloadable HD codec written in JS and WebGL. The advantages are many. On the good-for-the-open-web side: no encumbered-format burden on web browsers, they are just IP-blind runtimes. Technical wins start with the ability to evolve and improve the codec over time, instead of taking ten years to specify and burn it into silicon.</blockquote>I think the 'remote-screen viewing of videogames' use case is bogus (if anyone notices latency it's gamers), but this is a really important development for the reasons Brendan mentions and more. <p>Nine years ago, I <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2004/01/media-heresy-compression-is-becoming.html">wrote</a>: <p><blockquote>I'd say video compression is maybe 2-4 times as efficient (in quality per bit) than it was in 1990 or so when MPEG was standardised, despite computing power and storage having improved a thousandfold since then.</blockquote><p>Not much has changed. The video compression techniques we're using everywhere are direct descendents of 1980s signal processing. They treat video as a collection of small 2D blocks that move horizontally and vertically over time, and encode all video this way. If you want to make a codec work hard, you just need to rotate the camera. Partly this is because of the huge patent thicket around video encoding, mostly it's because compression gets less necessary over time as network capacity and storage increases. However, it was obvious 10 years ago that this was out-dated. <a href="http://www.bongiovi.tw/experiments/webgl/blossom/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v6CXtnIIzLs/UYfQ2wKsqiI/AAAAAAAAAE8/7XiXCjhTXA8/s320/Screen+shot+2013-05-06+at+8.48.09+AM.png" title="" /></a><p>Meanwhile, there has been a revolution in video processing. It's been going on in video games, and in movies and TV. The beautiful photorealistic scenes you now see in video games are because they are textured 3D models rendered on the fly for you. Even the cut scenes work this way, though their encoding is often what compression researchers dismissively call a 'Graduate Student Algorithm' - hand-tweaking the models and textures to play back well within the constraints of the device. Most movies and TV has also been through 3d-modelling and rendering, from Pixar through visual effects to the mundane superimposition of yard lines on sports. The proportion of YouTube that is animation, machinima or videogame run-throughs with commentary keeps growing too. <p>Yet codecs remain blind to this. All this great 3d work is reduced to small 2D squares. A trimesh and texture codec seems an obvious innovation - even phones have GPUs in them now, and desktops have for 20 years. Web browsers have been capable of <a href="http://leaverou.github.io/animatable/">complex animations</a> for ages <a href="http://waterstretch.ecoulon.com/">too</a>. Now they have the ability to decode bytestreams to <a href="http://alteredqualia.com/three/examples/webgl_terrain_dynamic.html">WebGL</a> in real time, we may finally get codecs that are up to the standards we expect from videogames, TV and movies, with the additional advantage of resolution independence. It's time for this change.

  <span class="p-name">Forking, Spooning or Knifing?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oAOHdxVgOn4/UV4y0M3vx4I/AAAAAAAAAEo/QVdJ7HKIano/s1600/microformats-dinner.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oAOHdxVgOn4/UV4y0M3vx4I/AAAAAAAAAEo/QVdJ7HKIano/s320/microformats-dinner.jpg" width="320" /></a><p>Reading the tech news this week, there's a lot of talk about forking. Google Blink forking AppKit. Apple not forking Chromium because that would be hostile. Facebook 'forking' Android. Even Tim O'Reilly forking the memetic nature of Free Software into Open Source. <p>However not all of these things are really forks, and forking is no longer necessarily a hostile act. Lets go through them. <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2013/04/blink-rendering-engine-for-chromium.html">Google Blink</a> is a fork of Webkit, or <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/google-going-its-own-way-forking-webkit-rendering-engine/">rather of Webcore</a>. <a href="http://infrequently.org/2013/04/probably-wrong/">Alex explains</a> this is to reduce the amount of time they need to spend merging back to Webkit, but it doesn't preclude anyone continuing to do this if desired. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5490242">Maciej explained</a> that the reason for the difference in multiprocessing implementations that precipitated this was Apple not wanting to do so. <p>Facebook <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2013/04/facebookqa/">did not need to fork Android</a>, because it is designed to support substitutable components. You can swap out any OS components, and you can communicate between apps using intents. Indeed, Facebook could make a deal with handset manufacturers or carriers that don't offer the 'with Google' experience to replace it with a Facebook one. Expect to see this in overseas markets, especially the ones where Facebook Zero works with carriers. <p>The more subtle thing is that forking is no longer perjorative. It used to be a last resort, what you did when your open source community had broken down. It meant that people had to pick sides, and choose which fork to adopt, because open source had a hierarchic nature. Now, <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2012/05/keep-all-versions.html">forking is what you do to show interest</a>. If you go to github, where much open source lives now, forking a project is a single click. Sucessful projects will have many forks, and will accept pull requests from some of them. <p>This is the real difference between the <a href="http://io9.com/annalee-i-think-you-do-a-real-disservice-to-both-open-466738177">Free Software and Open Source worldviews</a> that were debated this week - the web enables more parallel, less centralised forms of co-operation and ownership. The monolithic projects and integrations are giving way to ones with better defined boundaries between them, and the ability to combine components as needed. Which means tech companies don't get to tell each other to "<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Microsoft-Asked-Apple-to-Knife-the-Baby-Court-2980345.php">Knife the baby</a>" any more.

  <span class="p-name">DTLI Panel on 1201 rulemaking</span>

The new rule-making started in 2000.<br />(someone is testing a radio mic on the same frequency. Ironic given White Spaces interference lobby by radio mic users).<br />Rulemaking was originally designed to be formal, like a courtroom proceeding. It became less formal, and a periodic review of exemptions. The exemptions expire each three years and must be examined again. 2000 rulemaking was difficult as the provisions weren't yet in force. "It would be nice if legislation could be understood by the general public. Failing that it would be nice if it was understood by Copyright lawyers."<br />We had to interpret what a "class of works" consisted of as that was what we coudl exempt, but was not defined in the statute.<br /><br />Marcia Hofmann: I've been involved in all rounds so far. What does a successful argument look like? <br /><br />Rob Kasunic: Seth Finkelstein documented what he had done to achieve exemptions. Look at what had been successful. Many people who have got them repeatedly were not lawyers. Presenting a very strong factual case is key, compared to making a legal argument. It helps to come to the hearing but that is not a requirement.<br /><br />Rebecca Tushnet: I work with Vidders, a remix artists community. The hearings feel like Alice in Wonderland - the content people say that screen capture and other tools are circumvention, but they are available, and they won't go after fair use but they reserve the right to decide what isn't and so no exemption is needed.<br />Vidders are primarily made up of women, working with popular culture and non-commercial. Even though the Copyright Office should represent all creators, as outsiders we have to make this argument in perpetuity. Despite copyright protecting all creations, we need to make a case for creatiev quality and critical message, which is like explaining opera to non-fans.<br />The question 'Who gets to say what tools artists can use?' is very difficult. The content people argued that screen capture software was good enough, so cracking encrypted DVDs wasn't needed, despite generational loss. They said you don't need nice-looking stuff to use in your art. They also said that if we weren't getting good enough quality from screen capture they were doing it wrong. Hearing a bunch of guys who don't edit video telling a bunch of women who do that they are doing it wrong is a feature of the proceedings. You have to come back every 18 months are start again, and eventual people give up - like the dongle guy did. The copyright office cuts down your proposal each time, and more so if you don't come to the hearings. The burden of proof and the standards required to show that the use is substantial requires you to break the law in advance to show that it should be legal, which is highly problematic. Bruce Lehman told us about the process of enacting the DMCA. People making the next generation of media don't have lobbyists. they don't even have drivers licences today. They will surprise us like Facebook or Google. We need to let them surprise us in future.<br /><br />Christian Genetski: The EFF brought an exemption request for jailbreaking consoles that followed that from jailbreaking cellphones. As we (Video Game Manufacturers) prevailed, I see this as a fair process. In the mobile phone example there was a competition issue wrapped up in the DMCA. We made the case that this was different for game consoles, where we were protecting 3rd party creative works - the games. We didn't question the legitimacy of homebrew and indie games, but said we were trying to promote these consistent with protecting commercial ones. The evidence showed that vast majority of the tools were used for infringement, not for development or indie distribution. <br />I don't think the DMCA 1201 rule is broken per se, The use of the statute by creative litigators is not unique to the DMCA, there were other statutes cited in the same complaints.<br />If we need to adjust tot he reality of what is being used, taking a fresh look every 18 months seems like a good idea. This is better than going to Congress and meeting on K Street. Perhaps there is an execution and burden-shifting problem.<br /><br />Rob Kasunic: Burden-shifting is something we should consider for existing exemptions, to move the burden to opponents. The rule-making is not necessarily the answer to these issues. It's an adjunct to the statute. But for the rule-making process, Vidders would have all been unlawful. The Copyright office is not assessing 'good' works or legitimate art, but non-infringing use. When we use the term 'substantial' we didn't mean a higher burden of proof, but it needs to not be just mere inconveniences or anecdotal use. With vidding it was questionable if the use was non-infringing, but there needed to be sufficient that were.<br />Although 1201 exemptions only apply to the use exemptions, not the trafficking ones, when they passed they mean people can buy illegal tools for a legal purpose which is very odd.<br /><br />Rebecca Tushnet: The exemption we got said we could only use circumvention if necessary for sufficient quality. This was an artistic judgment encoded in the exemption.<br /><br />&nbsp;Granick: Trackphone continued to use 1201 against bulk unlockers as they were not doing it to unlock to connect to a network, but to profit by reselling phones, and have won these cases.<br /><br />Q: Why would it be up to Congress to change the burden? Couldn't the Copyright office change this?<br />Kasunic: there is a lot of expectations from Congress in the lawmaking, even if not in the legislation. We're trying to implement what Congress intended. We would be delighted to have Congress give us more information.<br /><br />Q: Copyright prevents actual copying and derivative works. What of we narrowed it down so derivative works weren't protected? How many problems would go away then?<br />Kasunic: Many of derivative works matter a lot eg movie adaptations. The line between derivative and transformative is a fine one.<br />Genetski: in the game industry the expansion packs and sequels are derivative and need to be protected.<br />Tushnet: people have been thinking hard about this. Substantial similarity has eaten this up. I wrote <a href="http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/125/january12/Article_8738.php">an article about this</a>.<br /><br /><br />

  <span class="p-name">The Antifragility of the Web</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>We’re used to taking the web for granted. We expect it to be there as substrate, with its addresses, declaratory documents, universally available programming language and the links between pages. <p>Ah, the links. There’s the rub. How many times have you followed a link and got a 404 or a different page than you were expecting? Links rot. As Tim Berners-Lee says, eventually every domain becomes a porn site. <p>So we want to do better. We want to build a non-web web. A special place for ourselves and our friends that is self-contained, and where all the pages and links are in the same database, and they can’t rot. <p>Instead of these messy links with protocols and domains in we just use @names or +names and #topics and tag. It’s easier for people to do, and self-consistent and grows explosively. Biz dev gets excited about the reciprocal deals we can do with other content owners. <p>If you’ve read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400067820/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400067820&linkCode=as2&tag=epeusepigone-20">Nasim Taleb’s Antifragile</a>, you know what comes next. By shielding people from the complexities of the web, by removing the fragility of links, we’re actually making things worse. We’re creating a fragility debt. Suddenly, something changes - money runs out, a pivot is declared, an aquihire happens, and the pent-up fragility is resolved in a Black Swan moment. <p>The special place disappears entirely. Or, if we’re lucky, the Archive Team lights the cat signal and emergency archivists preserve it in formaldehyde somewhere else, the clock stopped, the links severed. <p>Meanwhile, out there on the web, people can still connect and discuss and say what went wrong, and do better next time. The web itself is antifragile. It interprets our business models as damage and routes around them. If we’ve learned, we’ll respect this next time we make something.

  <span class="p-name">Viewing distance and CSS pixels: a solution?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I've been intermittently following the debate over <a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-May/036162.html">image alternatives at WHATWG</a>. Broadly, the issue is that different devices have wildly different pixel resolutions and viewing distances, so you want to serve different images for them (especially when the images have text burnt in - think of map tiles, for example). Currently this is done well by Responsive Design techniques - adapting to different devices based on their pixel size, and crudely by having a separate 'mobile' site with baked-in assumptions about which useragent has which density/size. Apple having released 2 sets of identically sized devices with power of 2 differences in pixel density has brought this to a head (though optimizing for this with 2x seems a bit of a kludge to me). <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Hz6UxmFH9nk/T8VorrcQkeI/AAAAAAAAAEI/r_BUQCpi6yc/s1600/pixel1.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear:right; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em"><img border="0" height="235" width="327" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Hz6UxmFH9nk/T8VorrcQkeI/AAAAAAAAAEI/r_BUQCpi6yc/s400/pixel1.png" /></a></div><p>I'm not going to get into the <code>picture</code> versus <code>srcset</code> debate here, but I did want to think more about what a 'CSS Pixel' corresponds to. If you read the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#absolute-lengths">CSS spec</a>, the reference pixel is defined in terms of both size and viewing distance. The trouble is, the viewing distance is not really determined or settable in current browsers. When we were mostly using desktop or laptop machines, with occasional projected versions for large audiences, the 'arms length assumption' was a reasonable shortcut. But with phones, tablets and TVs it breaks down. In particular it breaks down because of people's varying eyesight and near points.

  <span class="p-name">Keep ALL the versions</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Back in the 1980s, storage was expensive and slow. You had a copy of your document in memory and you would be asked every time you wanted to save it out to disk, because you didn't want to fill the disk up. That paradigm is so out of date now it's embarrassing to try to explain to my sons what the little floppy disk icon is in Microsoft Word. "What's that?" "it's a floppy disk." "Oh yeah, I think I saw one in the garage once" <p>The world view of having to load and save is being gradually eroded. Apple has changed the operating system - Mountain Lion no longer has Save and Save As, but instead a model of going back through edit histories. Google Docs originally didn’t have a floppy disk icon, but put it back because people were looking for it in user testing. Now it has been removed. <p>We've had source code control as programmers for a long time. But the github world takes that further: the first thing you do is clone a project into your own repository, then start forking it. You can eventually merge stuff back later, but there is the assumption that things are happening in parallel. As <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/">James Governor</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/monkchips/gluecon-keynote-13062429">put it</a>: <blockquote><p>Open Source used to count download numbers as a measure of developer success.<p>Today, we increasingly use forks as the metric of traction.</blockquote><p>Wikipedia has put this into the public consciousness by having publicly visible edit histories, so you can go back and forwards in time over the history of the article. The paradigm of "storage is not a problem, we should keep every version of everything ever" is moving through culture to be a default assumption. <p>This will be something we want on mobile too. The issue of "which have I got on the phone and which have I got in the cloud?” is what makes it tricky. I think there will be a battle between Apple and Google about how you present that to the user in a coherent way - Google Drive and iCloud are taking different paths here, with DropBox actually working between both. Google Drive not storing copies of Google Documents locally is a mistake I expect them to fix. <p>Everything is moving in this direction, even low level system design. The growth of <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html">functional programming</a> is all about not having contention over a single copy of things in memory but having paths through data that are modifying things in their own version of the world. <p>If you think about the difference between the way JavaScript handles stuff and the way Java does, Java still has a ‘data structure being passed around’ world view; JavaScript has closures that are passed around that contain the entire state of the current machine at the time of that event which are held as you go off and do something else and come back. One of the reasons that <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> feels so nice when you're writing web programming is that it has the feeling you’re used to on the client side that you do something and then call something, passing it a callback. You end up writing the server side stuff in the same way, and it's just naturally parallelizable. It's <a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/5/24/cedar_goes_ga/">easy to spin up more machines</a> for it because you've written stuff with the presumption that each instance of it is wholly independent. <p>Not everything can be written that way. The core of node is in C because it has to deal with the raw machine contention and deal with this routing, but the spread of the functional world view is a natural fit for web apps. <p>The other potential that node.js makes manifest is convergence of client and server code. If you're running and writing the same code in the same language, with the same libraries running on both the client and the server you can decide to migrate bits back and forth much more easily. <p>You don’t have to spend so much time deciding which is which and without worrying about the boundaries of the world and different shapes of the data structures. So if you're creating a JSON object on the server and passing it to the client you can decide whether you do that or not, at which point you do that, at which point you render it and which point you don't. That sort of fluidity is going to become more important over time. <a href="http://blog.superpat.com/">Pat Patterson</a> showed how <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/metadaddy/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-app-server-building-a-twotier-mobile-app-13063405">this can work for mobile apps too</a>. <p>The programmers' world view has changed on this and it is permeates out to the world as programmers make those ideas available to the public in usable form. The invention of ‘Undo’ was a huge part of what made the Mac great - enabling users to experiment safely. Being able to retrospectively undo mistakes later, or learn from others’ public variations on a theme is going mainstream too. <p>This post is based on discussions I had on <a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-google/143">This Week In Google ep 143</a>, with <a href="http://ginatrapani.org">Gina Trapani</a>, <a href="http://buzzmachine.com">Jeff Jarvis</a> and <a href="http://www.tommerritt.com/">Tom Merritt</a> which were <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4_OhYNYehxkmomYWT6gPXOzKrIBZvZHDRkVQgA5sbs/edit">transcribed</a> by <a href="http://mshook.appspot.com/z/d4m.htm?/mshook">Michael Shook</a> from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk0q75-7z40">this video of the show</a> Updated: At the same time, JP Rangaswami wrote <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2012/05/24/warnings/">Warning: Contains Warnings</a> which give more context about how 'Undo' helps protect innovation.

  <span class="p-name">WiFi - Born Free, but Everywhere In Chains</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>According to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/05/passpoint-wifi-tech-promises-cellphone-like-handoff-between-hotspots.ars">Ars Technica</a>:<blockquote>An industry group that aims to make WiFi access from smartphones and other devices as simple as connecting to a cellular network will begin certifying WiFi network equipment and end-user devices for the new connection method next month.</blockquote><p>What bizarro world bullshit is this? Connecting to a cellular network is simple? They're all over the place and mutually incompatible and have horrendous billing rigamaroles you need to go through. I've stayed in a hotel in the north of Washington State where my phone decided to connect to Rogers in Canada, and as <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/application-cache-is-a-douchebag/">Jake Archibald</a> puts it "When I use data abroad I can almost hear the champagne corks popping in the offices of my network provider". <p>By contrast, WiFi is a single global set of standards, with 2 well-defined network behaviours:<ol><li><h4>An open network</h4> In this case, your device will notice it, and offer to connect to it. Once connected it will use Zeroconf to discover an IP address, routing information an nearby printers or other useful resource like shared speakers, nearby music libraries or people to chat to, and off you go. <li><h4>A password-protected network</h4> You'll be able to choose this, and someone nearby can tell you the password, or it will be written on a whiteboard or poster. Then you Zeroconf away as before.</ol><p>Now, back when Zeroconf and DHCP were being defined, the idea that you might want to send a message, or even a webpage, to people connecting to your WiFi network was thought of, specified and shipped - the OS X Airport Utility lets you set these, and Macs will show the message on connecting. However, this was ignored, in favour of the third option:<ol><li><h4>A broken network</h4> This all-too-common situation is a network that purports to be an open network, but actually redirects everything to</ol>

The so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Birthday Paradox</a> is kicking in. This is named for the unexpected result that if you have 23 people in a room, there's a 50:50 chance two of them have the same birthday. <br /><p>There's a similar effect with games. If you keep randomly picking a word from a list, you'll see repeats quickly. Classic board games understand this - this is why Balderdash, Pictionary, Trivial Pursuit etc insist you use a discard pile after shuffling and picking a question, so you only pick a new card from those you haven't seen. Draw Something isn't doing this, so we're all seeing words repeat, which is discouraging play. This is all over twitter too:<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Too many repeat words in DrawSomething. :|</p>&mdash; Shreya Ghoshal (@shreyaghoshal) <a href="https://twitter.com/shreyaghoshal/status/185555817074933760" data-datetime="2012-03-30T02:35:28+00:00">March 30, 2012</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I've played Draw Something too much so every word now is a repeat. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%2523firstworldpain">#firstworldpain</a></p>&mdash; ∆li (@AleeZaidee) <a href="https://twitter.com/AleeZaidee/status/186302364112785408" data-datetime="2012-04-01T04:01:59+00:00">April 1, 2012</a></blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Just now coming off a week-long "Draw Something" binge.

  <span class="p-name">When you're the merchandise, not the customer</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://futureoftheinternet.org/meme-patrol-when-something-online-is-free-youre-not-the-customer-youre-the-product">Jonathan Zittrain posted today</a> that he is not the source of the quote widely attributed to him: <br /><blockquote>I participated in the Berkman Center’s fascinating <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/6810">HyperPublic symposium</a> in the summer of 2011. When moderating a panel I invoked the aphorism that “When something online is free, you’re not the customer, you’re the product.” It’s a way of encapsulating the idea that online free services usually make money by extracting lots of data from users — and then selling that data, or using it for targeted availability of those users for advertising, to advertisers. In that sense, the advertisers are the clients, and the users enjoying free content are what’s being sold. (Of course, sometimes that happens even when the user pays.)<br /><br />I didn’t coin the phrase, and since it was featured (and attributed to me!) in wordsmith.org’s wildly popular “word a day” as a thought for the day accompanying the word “<a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/enceinte.html">enceinte</a>” — I sought to nail down its provenance.<br /><br />The first use of the quote that we can find is as a comment within the famed <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046">MetaFilter</a> community in August 2010. The user’s name is blue_beetle, who might be someone named <a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2011/09/found_quotes_10.php">Andrew Lewis</a>. It’s entirely possible I saw it there, as MeFi is one of my <a href="http://first-5.tumblr.com/post/18754189471/jonathanzittrain">five favorite sites</a> on the Web.</blockquote><p>I was pretty sure this idea dates back further, so I went digging. First I found <a href="http://www.joshklein.net/ahead-of-the-curve-business-school">Josh Klein's 2009 blogpost</a>, which cites Philip Broughton's 2008 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594201757/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594201757">Ahead of the Curve: Two Years at Harvard Business School</a><br /><blockquote>"My favorite moment comes in an anecdote about an MBA candidate who, not getting his way, complains to an administrator, “I’m the customer! Why are you treating me so badly?”<br /><br />To which the administrator responds, “you’re not the customer. You’re the product.”</blockquote><p>But the sense is not quite the same there - an MBA is not a free web service after all. Going back a little further, this 2006 discussion at Joel on Software <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.422590.21">Is the Magical Fairy-tale For Google Engineers about to End?</a> (nicely prefiguring James Whittaker's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jw_on_tech/archive/2012/03/13/why-i-left-google.aspx">Why I left Google</a>) includes this contribution from Drew K:<br /><blockquote>Like clam pointed out, Google's customers are the advertisers. "Skooter" is a user. Just like with ad-supported broadcast TV, you're not the customer, you're the product.</blockquote><p>The idea is pretty well-expressed there, but I think we can go back further. In 2004, Coding Forums <a href="http://www.codingforums.com/showthread.php?t=39589">discussed the then-new Gmail</a>, and <a href="http://www.codingforums.com/showpost.php?p=206569&postcount=9">liorian commented</a>: <blockquote>From a Google perspective, you're not the customer. The ad service buyer is the customer. You're the commodity. By making you a more attractive commodity, i.e. by making sure to only serve you an ad if you are in the target population for it, they are making the ads pay better for their customers, and they can reap a large part of the difference to their competitors, the other ad services.</blockquote><p>This isn't a new idea then, as the analogy to television makes clear. The earliest, most thorough exegesis of this idea I have found is Claire Wolfe's 1999 article <a href="http://www.loompanics.com/Articles/LittleBrother.html"><b>Little brother is watching you</b> The Menace of Corporate America</a> which opens with:<br /><blockquote>Perhaps because you're not the customer any more. You're simply a "resource" to be managed for profit. The customer is someone else now — and usually someone without your best interests at heart.</blockquote>And has a continuing refrain of “Who is the Customer? Not you”, ending with <blockquote>Who is the customer? Not you, whose life is reduced to someone else's salable, searchable, investigatable data. The customer is everyone who wishes to own a piece of your life.</blockquote><p>The underlying warning is definitely worth thinking about — Maciej Ceglowski eloquently made the case for why you should pay Software Artisans on <a href="http://tummelvision.tv/2011/12/30/tummelvision-91-maciej-ceglowski-of-pinboard/">a recent TummelVision</a> — but the deeper changes to what it means to be a customer matter too. There are other things we take part in without paying or being sold, because we find shared value in them, and the net enables those too.

  <span class="p-name">QR Codes: bad idea or terrible idea?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>People have a problem finding your URL. You post a QR Code. Now they have 2 problems. Or more:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yC-tQ3Fhx-U/TyQzmPEh70I/AAAAAAAAADw/LWwr3GOyRY4/s1600/QRpost.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear:right; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em"><img border="0" height="320" width="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yC-tQ3Fhx-U/TyQzmPEh70I/AAAAAAAAADw/LWwr3GOyRY4/s320/QRpost.png" /></a></div><br /><ol><li>They see a chunk of <a href="http://robotbarf.com">robot barf</a> on your poster, and have to realise it isn't a crossword puzzle, but a QR code.<br /><li>They need to take a digital photograph of it with their phone. If they have a laptop, even with a camera, this requires physical contortions<br /><li>They need an application on their phone that can make sense of a QR code. <br /><li>They need a lot of patience as they fiddle with it.<br /><li>They need a working network connection to resolve it.</ol><p>Conversely, with a URL they could type it in, take a photograph of it and type it in later, or if they have the right app, it will recognise the URL text from the image and make it clickable. <p>That is the irony of this. QR Codes ignore years of research and culture on how to communicate meaning in symbolic form designed to be captured by image processing tools behind a lens. We have this technology. It is called writing. <p>Written language has a set of symbols that are relatively unambiguous, that are formed of curves rather than hard edges making them resilient to noise, and have been market-tested for milennia. QR Codes don't just ignore this, they ignore the relative success of one dimensional barcodes. Notice something about a barcode? It has the number printed on it as well, so you can type it in if the scan fails. QR Codes don't do this, so it's far too easy to put the wrong one in, or fail to replace a mockup. Which is why so many QR codes <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/2011/03/why-does-that-qr-code-take-me-to-justinsomnia-org/">link to Justin's site instead</a>.<p>The only place you should use QR codes is if you have a dedicated reader for them, like a classic barcode scanner, and a workflow that is designed for this that actually saves time. If you do empirical research on using QR codes for the public, you'll likely see 80% worse performance than text <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/2012/01/04/qr-in-the-new-year/">like this museum did</a>. By all means try the experiment and report your results. Put up a QR code and a printed URL and see which gets the most usage.<p>Or <a href="http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2011/11/web-semantics-those-little-microchip-square-box-things/">listen to others</a>:<blockquote>a majority of our respondents knew more or less what they were for, very few (n=2, or around 7%) were successfully able to use QR codes to resolve a URL, even when coached by a knowledgeable researcher.[..] A strong theme that emerged — which we certainly found entirely unsurprising, but which ought to give genuine pause to the cleverer sort of marketers — is that, even where respondents displayed sufficient awareness and understanding of QR codes to make use of them, virtually no one expressed any interest in actually doing so.</blockquote><p>As <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/qr-codes-are-the-rolling-skating-horses-of-advertising/252128/">Alexis Madrigal puts it</a>:<blockquote>Is it really faster and better to use a QR code that will direct you to part of a marketing campaign rather than getting a broader sweep of information by simply using the browser that you already use all the time on your phone? In the instant cost-benefit analysis I do every time I see a QR code, it has yet to make sense for me to fire up the decoder app I have installed on my phone.</blockquote><p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>QR code at the bus stop to get time of next bus.

  <span class="p-name">Google Plus admits they want fake names</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Today, after 7 months, Bradley Horowitz announced that <a href="https://plus.google.com/113116318008017777871/posts/SM5RjubbMmV">Google Plus will accept some pseudonyms</a>. Kinda. If you can prove you're already famous. And can convince their robot it looks like a name. However, Google Engineer <a href="https://plus.google.com/103389452828130864950">Yonatan Zunger</a> spills the beans in a comment on that thread:<blockquote>First of all, you might ask why we have a names policy at all. (i.e., why we don’t simply go with the JWZ proposal) One thing which we have discovered, while putting some miles on the system, is that it is indeed important to have a name-based service rather than a handle-based service. This isn’t a matter of functionality so much as of community: You get a different kind of community when people are known as Mary Smith than when they are known as captaincrunch42, and for a social product in particular we decided that the first kind of community is the one we want to build. In order to do that, we want to establish a general norm that the names you put in to the system should be names, not handles. <br /><br />So one thing that our name checking flow tries to catch is handles, which should normally be nicknames, shown in addition to a name. The other important thing it’s trying to catch is people who are creating individual accounts, rather than +Pages, for non-human entities such as businesses or organizations. The behavior of +Pages is deliberately restricted in the system, and we don’t want people to be creating fake human accounts to circumvent that. The name check turns out to be a very powerful tool to catch these.<br /><br />Our name check is therefore looking, not for things that don’t look like “your” name, but for things which don’t look like names, period. In fact, we do not give a damn whether the name posted is “your” name or not: we will not challenge you on this basis, nor is there any mechanism for other users to cause you to be challenged for this. <br /><br />There are two main cases where the name check screws up. One is false positives: people (such as you) who have unusual names which get flagged because they looked like handles. Being able to appeal via things such as drivers’ licenses is useful for this case, since it’s a simple “oh, we got this wrong.” The other case is people such as +trench coat, who are so well-known under this handle that it would be bizarre not to let them onto the system under this name. For this case, we allow appeals based on being well-known under the name: thus the ability to prove the “established pseudonym.” We’ve deliberately set the threshold for that latter case fairly high for now, but we intend to continue to tune it; the objective is that the frequency of such names should basically be the same as their frequency in meatspace.<br /><br />So to answer your questions one-by-one:<br /><br />(2) “Meaningful following” only applies to cases of established pseudonyms which do not look like names. The definition of “meaningful” is deliberately vague so that we can tune it, so that it behaves in a natural fashion.<br /><br />(3) That’s correct; drivers’ licenses are for false positives, not pseudonyms.<br /><br />(4) Unusual names will indeed hit friction, because of false positives. We’re trying to minimize that, but it’s going to take some trial and error.<br /><br />(5) Google+ can absolutely be your first identity online. No matter what your language, no matter where you come from. The “established pseudonym” logic should apply to a very small subset of people. If some groups are seeing a higher false positive rate than others, that’s a bug, not a feature, and we have the data available to spot this situation and remedy it.</blockquote>(posted in full, in case of subsequent retraction, and because G+ doesn't have permalinks for comments)<br /><br />Yonatan admits what Bradley obscures:that this is an Identity Theatre issue. They don't want your name, They don't care if you have a forename in one language and a surname in another. Let me quote this exactly:<br /><br /><blockquote>Our name check is therefore looking, not for things that don’t look like “your” name, but for things which don’t look like names, period. In fact, we do not give a damn whether the name posted is “your” name or not: we will not challenge you on this basis, nor is there any mechanism for other users to cause you to be challenged for this. </blockquote><br />This is what I suspected when I wrote <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2011/08/google-plus-must-stop-this-identity.html">Google Plus must stop this Identity Theatre</a><br /><br />Google+ is letting an algorithm decide what is a name and what isn't. You will be forced into it's Procrustean idea of what names are, or be harassed for it. You have to pass as normal, like call centre workers forced to learn to sound American.<br /><br />You can create disposable accounts with fake names, as long as they look plausible to Yonatan's bot.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BQ-9MgsqOsk/Tx3eFdw7wNI/AAAAAAAAAC4/vhaVt7KEMRk/s1600/mehr.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear:right; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em"><img border="0" height="200" width="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BQ-9MgsqOsk/Tx3eFdw7wNI/AAAAAAAAAC4/vhaVt7KEMRk/s320/mehr.jpg" /></a></div><br /><br />This algorithm has allowed people called '<a href="https://plus.google.com/111552465437874299002">panel heater</a>' '<a href="https://plus.google.com/112977076860539560195">The Phoenix Rising</a>' '<a href="https://plus.google.com/116916990172132916157">tous les mais du monde</a>' and <a href="https://plus.google.com/112034145206762608254">Mehr Decent</a> , a bot with <a href="http://sanjaal.com/ganthan/2618/picture-post/pakistani-tv-drama-actress-sara-jamot-high-resolution-photos/">a well-known actress's photo</a> posting links to a single website to follow me (and that's just in the most recent 30 I checked).<br /><br />So Google continues to encourage fakers and discourage those who <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/case-pseudonyms">need a pseudonym for good reasons</a>.

  <span class="p-name">Could Apple make premium devices in the USA?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>After <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/454/mr-daisey-and-the-apple-factory">This American Life's disturbing episode</a> on Apple's Chinese factories, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all">NYT wrote a defence of Apple</a>, which said it was just too expensive to build their products in the USA:<br /><blockquote>Not long ago, Apple boasted that its products were made in America. Today, few are. Almost all of the 70 million iPhones, 30 million iPads and 59 million other products Apple sold last year were manufactured overseas.<br /><br />Why can’t that work come home? Mr. Obama asked.<br /><br />Mr. Jobs’s reply was unambiguous. “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” he said. </blockquote><p>For computers, phones and tablets, it's hard to make a real premium product, as the economies of scale work so well - Tim Cook's Apple has closed in on PC prices by a focus on costs and suppliers, and by building fewer models and relying on Chinese flexibility to ramp them up.<br /><p>The <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/luxury-ipad-2-comes-covered-in-gold-diamonds-and-dinosaur-bones/">Gold iPad 2</a> had a huge premium price, but also weighed more the 3 times as much as a normal iPad.<br /><p>Instead, what if Apple made premium USA iPads, MacBooks and iPhones? They could have a distinctive look, so people knew they were US made, focus on the higher-end models, and charge a premium markup for the warm glow of supporting US jobs.<br /><p>How much more would it cost? Hard to say, according to the NYT:<br /><blockquote>It is hard to estimate how much more it would cost to build iPhones in the United States. However, various academics and manufacturing analysts estimate that because labor is such a small part of technology manufacturing, paying American wages would add up to $65 to each iPhone’s expense. Since Apple’s profits are often hundreds of dollars per phone, building domestically, in theory, would still give the company a healthy reward.<br />[...]<br />Another critical advantage for Apple was that China provided engineers at a scale the United States could not match. Apple’s executives had estimated that about 8,700 industrial engineers were needed to oversee and guide the 200,000 assembly-line workers eventually involved in manufacturing iPhones. The company’s analysts had forecast it would take as long as nine months to find that many qualified engineers in the United States.<br /><br />In China, it took 15 days.<br />[...]<br />A few years after Mr. Saragoza started his job, his bosses explained how the California plant stacked up against overseas factories: the cost, excluding the materials, of building a $1,500 computer in Elk Grove was $22 a machine. In Singapore, it was $6. In Taiwan, $4.85. Wages weren’t the major reason for the disparities.

Make the 'made in USA' a key argument for a premium price. that way you need fewer staff than in China, and paying them well just adds to the cachet of the devices. You could cover them in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_Johns">Jasper Johns</a> Flag, visibly number them as a limited edition, or come up with something more creative. As a way of extending the product line to a new, higher price point, while quieting those who wish Apple did more in the US, it seems an a obvious move.

  <span class="p-name">Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus shun HTML, causing the infographic plague.</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>By choosing images over links, and by restricting markup, Facebook, Twitter and Google+ are hostile to HTML. This is leading to the plague of infographics crowding out text, and of video used to convey minimal information.<p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://trends.google.com/trends?q=infographic&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0" imageanchor="1" style="clear:right; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em"><img border="0" height="270" width="226" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tb7QjtrYQ00/Tvj7idKtq7I/AAAAAAAAACg/rC15PfdQTMs/s320/Screen%2Bshot%2B2011-12-26%2Bat%2B2.50.04%2BPM.png" alt="graph from Google trends of rising incidence of 'infographic' since 2009" /></a></div><p>The rise of so-called infographics has been out of control this year, though the term was unknown a couple of years ago. I attribute this to the favourable presentation that image links get within Facebook, followed by Twitter and Google plus, and of course though other referral sites like Reddit. By showing a preview of the image, the item is given extra weight over a textual link; indeed even for a url link, Facebook and G+ will show an image preview by default.<p>Consequently, the dominant form of expression has become the image. This was already happening with LOLcats and other meme generators like Rage Comics, where a <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35l3dm/">trite observation can be dressed up with an image</a> or series of images.<p><div class="thumbnail"><a href="https://skitch.com/kevinmarks/gw8yf/yunolikehtml" style="clear:right; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20111227-eckcfamgjng4ytkcg9msd3x592.preview.png" alt="Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Y U no like HTML, just pix?" /></a><br /></div><p>Before this, in the blogging age, there was a weight given to prose pieces, and Facebook and Google preserve some of this, but the expressiveness of HTML through linking, quoting, using images inline, changing font weight and so on, is filtered out by the crude editing tools they make available.<p>Feeds and feed readers started out this way too, but rapidly gained the ability to include HTML markup. Twitter went back to the beginning, and added the extra constrain of 140 characters because of it's initial SMS focus. Now it is painfully reinventing markup, though the gigantic envelope and wrapper of metadata that accompanies every tweet. This now has an edit list for entities pointing into it, and instructions for how to parse this to regain the author's intent is part of the overhead of working with their API.<p>Image links, however — at least those from recognised partners — are given privileged treatment. Facebook and Google have emulated this too, leading to the 'trite quote as image' trope. The spillover of this to news organisations <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/12/ending-the-infographic-plague/250474/">became complete this year</a>, with blogs and newspapers falling over themselves to link to often-tendentious information presented in all-caps and crude histogram form.<p>So here's my plea for 2012: Twitter, Facebook, Google+: please provide equal space for HTML. And for authors and designers everywhere, stop making giant bitmaps when well-written text with charts that are worth the bytes spent on them could convey your message better.<br /><p><b>Update:</b> My son made a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/nsnis/an_article_my_dad_wrote_in_rage_form_link_to_the/">Rage Comic version</a> of this post (with <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/nsicz/silly_dad_just_happened/">an explanation</a>) why.

  <span class="p-name">Our brains make the social graph real</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Brilliant web essayist <a href="http://idlewords.com/">Maciej Cegłowski</a> of <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/2006/04/argentina_on_two_steaks_a_day.htm">Two Steaks</a> and <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> fame has focused his considerable insight on the area of web standards I've been involved with for the past few years. You should go and read his <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/11/the_social_graph_is_neither/">The Social Graph is Neither</a> now.<p>Maciej is spot on in his criticisms:<blockquote><p>This obsession with modeling has led us into a social version of the Uncanny Valley, that weird phenomenon from computer graphics where the more faithfully you try to represent something human, the creepier it becomes. As the model becomes more expressive, we really start to notice the places where it fails.<p>Personally, I think finding an adequate data model for the totality of interpersonal connections is an AI-hard problem. But even if you disagree, it's clear that a plain old graph is not going to cut it.</blockquote><p>Clearly you can't model human relationships exactly in software. Keeping track of a few hundred of them in all their nuanced subtlety is why our brains are so huge compared to other animals. As <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html">Douglas Adams</a> put it:<blockquote>Of course you can’t ‘trust’ what people tell you on the web anymore than you can ‘trust’ what people tell you on megaphones, postcards or in restaurants. Working out the social politics of who you can trust and why is, quite literally, what a very large part of our brain has evolved to do.</blockquote><p>It is an act of hubris to attempt to represent such vital things as human relationships in a database, and those who have done so often do resemble Maciej's Mormon bartender - Orkut Büyükkökten, Mark Zuckerberg and Jonathan Abrams do seem to have made what danah boyd has called <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/Supernova2004.html">Autistic Social Software</a>.<p>The thing is, people seem to find these attempts helpful. As Maciej points out, we're good at forming subcultures and relationships even around the most primitive of tools. He pokes fun at <code>opensocial.Enum.Drinker.HEAVILY</code>, but when we were compiling the <a href="http://opensocial-resources.googlecode.com/svn/spec/trunk/Social-Data.xml#Person">OpenSocial Person fields</a>, we found a high degree of convergence between the 20 or so social network sites we reviewed. Despite their crudity, the billions of people using these sites do find something of interest in them.<p>People choose to model different relationships on different sites and applications, but being able to avoid re-entering them anew each time by importing some or all from another source makes this easier. The <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">Social Graph API</a> may return results that are a little frayed or out of date, but humans can cope with that and smart social sites will let them edit the lists and selectively connect the new account to the web. Having a common data representation doesn't mean that all data is revealed to all who ask; we have OAuth to reveal different subsets to different apps, if need be.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LOyvcPqL5S4/TruAgcUSfZI/AAAAAAAAACI/wR1mG1aIPvA/s1600/brain.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear:right; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em"><img border="0" height="301" width="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LOyvcPqL5S4/TruAgcUSfZI/AAAAAAAAACI/wR1mG1aIPvA/s320/brain.png" /></a></div><p>The real value comes from combining these imperfect, scrappy computerized representations of relationships with the rich, nuanced understandings we have stored away in our cerebella. With the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/05/faces-call-trust-code-in-our-brains.html">face</a> of your <code>friend</code>, <code>acquaintance</code> or <code>crush</code> next to what they are saying, your brain is instantly engaged and can decide whether they are joking, flirting or just being a grumpy poet again, and choose whether to signal that you have seen it or not.<p>As <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/12/14/valuing_ineffic.html">danah says</a>:<blockquote>While we want perfect reliability for our own needs, we also want there to be failures in the system so that we can blame technology when we don’t want to admit to our own weaknesses. In other words, we want plausible deniability. We want to be able to blame our spam filters when we failed to respond to an email that someone sent that we didn’t feel like answering. We want to blame cell phone reception when we’ve had enough of a conversation and “accidentally” hang up. The more reliable technology gets, the more we have to find new ways for blaming the technology so that we don’t have to do the socially rude thing.</blockquote><p>So here's to approximate, incomplete social web standards.

  <span class="p-name">'with Amazon' replacing 'with Google' on Android?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Amazon is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/26/amazon-kindle-fire/">set to launch an Android Tablet on Wednesday</a>. What if they license their code too? Android as experienced on phones is actually <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2011/01/two-faces-of-android.html">two separate software bundles</a> - the Open Source core of Android, and the proprietary 'with Google' applications, including the App Market, Maps, Gmail, Talk, Contacts, Listen and other apps bound to Google services, and requiring a business development deal to ship with a device. Eric Schmidt <a href="http://youtu.be/JDl5hb0XbfY?t=27m">explicitly discussed this strategy at Dreamforce</a>.<br /><p>Now there are already more Android devices than I can count that don't follow the 'with Google' playbook, including the Barnes & Noble Nook that probably inspired this response from Amazon, but there are hints of a broader strategy here. What if Amazon offered an alternative to Google's top half of Android? I think Amazon does not really want to be in the hardware design business, but wants to be sure that they can't be locked out of it or forced to pay extra by Apple, Google or any other potential competitor. As well as releasing their own 7" tablet, they could offer an Open Source or lightly licensed version of their stack to other hardware developers. <br /><p>Why would Amazon do this? Because they are primarily in the shopping and media business. Apple has stopped them selling eBooks and media inside their apps on iPad/iPhone; Google has banned their App Store from the Google Android Market. Amazon could even offer a referral fee for anything bought via their store as an incentive for device manufacturers to ship it.<br /><p>An even bolder step wold be to actually fork Android. Google has a delayed-open model for Android source, where a new version is released in public after a closed development process, without a clear way to send in patches to Google. Amazon could put their current version up on Github, accept patches, and treat Google's new drops as another source of possible patches.<br /><p>Understanding each company's core business is what makes this likely. Apple is in the devices business, with the media business as a small side earner designed to make their devices more attractive. Google is in the Advertising business, with their Android business designed to make searching everywhere, continuously more likely. Amazon is in the shopping business, migrating from physical goods to media, with Kindle a way to drive this. A tablet that they can sell audio and video to as well as eBooks makes more sense to them if it as widely distributed as Kindle playback apps are now.

  <span class="p-name">Is Netflix picking the right disruption?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>The <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/explanation-and-some-reflections.html">decision to split Netflix into two companies</a>, with the poorly-named Qwikster getting the DVD by post business and Netflix keeping the streaming business has caused a lot of fuss. <a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2011/09/18/understanding-why-netflix-changed-pricing/">Bill Gurley suggests</a> that this is due to the very different licensing regimes the two businesses work under, and <a href="https://twitter.com/claychristensen/status/115846823079456769">Clayton Christensen</a> has praised this an a rare example of a company <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-splits-itself-in-two-to-avoid-the-innovators-dilemma-2011-9?utm_source=twbutton&utm_medium=social&utm_term=&utm_content=&utm_campaign=research">pre-emptively disrupting</a> itself.<br /><p>However, Reed Hastings gave rather non-plussed responses to those who complained about not having the two queues (DVD and streaming) integrated. As <a href="http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10150822026145425&id=724885424">danah said</a>,<br /><blockquote>It may seem logical to split the world based on business models from the inside of a business, but if you want your business to succeed, you should be focusing on understanding your users' mental models. And those aren't organized along business lines. They're organized around movies that they like, obtained by the means that is appropriate to the particular context of that user. People understand Netflix through its database of movies and the ratings that they've spent time providing, not its distinct queues.</blockquote><p>Hastings clearly isn't thinking about this from our point of view - we want to watch something, and are much less focused on the particular medium. Instead of separating the two modes, Netflix should be uniting them further - help us book cinema tickets too, or buy Blu-ray discs. Encourage us to bring in information on favourite films and TV shows from Facebook, Amazon, GetGlue. They still could do this in an exemplary way by having Netflix and Qwikster share users' information through public APIs that others could use too. <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> was made for this.<br /><p>Being on the users' side in this way is another disruption, and indeed several startups at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/14/the-ultimate-guide-to-techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2011/">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> had this mindset - what Doc Searls's <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page">VRM project</a> calls '4th party tools' - ones that mediate between the customer and the vendor on the customers behalf. <a href="https://cakehealth.com/">Cake Health</a> mediate between you and insurers, <a href="http://talkto.com/">TalkTo</a> between you and local shops, <a href="http://disrupt.flickmunk.com/">FlickMunk</a> between you and cinemas, and <a href="http://www.u4them.org/">u4them</a> as a way to donate to others medical bills.<br /><p>The deeper currents of disruption of the film and TV industry are showing up in music. At <a href="http://sfmusictech.com/">SF Music Tech</a> last week, <a href="http://turntable.fm">turntable.fm</a> was on everyone's lips, as the site that has got us all sitting round playing music for each other again, like the older label execs fondly remember from the 1970s. What it has done is apply the semi-overlapping <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html">publics and sharing models of twitter</a> to listening to music together.<br /><p>The other critique of Netflix that I saw was <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/09/the-qwikster-and-the-dead/245303/">Megan McCardle saying</a> that they were freeloading on the studios by only paying the marginal cost. Someone has to fund the creation, she pleads with us. Again, the answer was assumed at SF Music Tech, in the form of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, which explicitly encourages people to fund production, and not just at marginal cost either. A key part of a successful Kickstarter project is widely spaced payment options, the special deals that are really about showing support with largesse. That these are power-law distributed seems odd at first sight - why would people pay more? But in fact it makes perfect sense. Income and wealth are power-law distributed in the US too, so people can pick the level of patronage that fits their income. <br /><p>Independent artists like <a href="http://www.pomplamoose.com/">Pomplamoose</a> and <a href="http://www.zoekeating.com/">Zoë Keating</a> are not served by the commodity pricing of Spotify - many are <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/09/20/indie-labels-quitting-spotify-trouble-in-paradise/">removing their songs</a> from the catalog; they'd rather host them for download themselves. Zoë reports that her <a href="http://music.zoekeating.com/album/into-the-trees">Bandcamp site</a>, which lets you pay as much as you like for an album, has received payments of $8 to $500. Because they want to support her. <br /><p>Cory Doctorow <a href="http://www.internetevolution.com/document.asp?doc_id=171555&page_number=5">once said</a> that "If big-budget movies might turn into opera, then long-form narrative books might turn into poetry." Opera has long understood the power-law distribution of wealth, and seeks donations in the same kind of structure.<br /><p>In some ways, this power-law distribution of price is visible throughout commerce in the US. You can pay anything from $1 to <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/01/08/is-this-burger-worth-5000/">$5000</a> for a burger, with price points inbetween, similarly for housing, transport, drinks, clothing, shoes, you name it. <p>The <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/07/heads-or-tails-no-heads-and-tails.html">old economic choice</a> between a commodity business that's all about margins, or a fashion business that is about competing for the most popular spot is finding a new accommodation. The discovery mechanisms like Turntable, Spotify, Pandora, and yes even Netflix, need to connect to these artist empowering patronage sites, as well as the commodity playback from the industrial aggregators. They need to lead people to Kickstarter and Bandcamp too. They need to be convenient, comprehensive and supportive of those creating art.<br /><p><b>Update:</b>Zoë Keating on <a href="http://mymusicthing.com/zoe-keating-on-spotify-apple-and-indies-and-lettuce/">Spotify, Apple and Independents (and lettuce)</a>

  <span class="p-name">Google Plus must stop this Identity Theatre</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Bruce Schneier in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387026207/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20">Beyond Fear</a> coined a phrase:<br /><blockquote>one of the goals of a security countermeasure is to provide people with a feeling of security in addition to the reality. But some countermeasures provide the feeling of security <i>instead of</i> the reality. These are nothing more than <i>security theater</i>. They're palliative at best.</blockquote><p>The Common Names debâcle at Google Plus is a variant of this, where the supposed protections are manifestly not working. Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/support/+/bin/answer.py?answer=1228271">stated policy</a> on this is that you should use your 'common name' - normatively defined to have exactly two words in it, in a naïve English speaking way, that fails in a huge number of common English cases, let alone other languages.<br /><p><a href="https://plus.google.com/111091089527727420853/posts/Fddn6rV8mBX#111091089527727420853/posts/Fddn6rV8mBX">Vic Gundotra has said</a> <blockquote>he is trying to make sure a positive tone gets set here. Like when a restaurant doesn't allow people who aren't wearing shirts to enter.</blockquote><p>so it is explicitly designed to exclude 'people not like us' from the space.<br /><p>Early users can set the tone for a network, but one that has aspirations to include most people will need to support multiple different communities within it. If you want a positive tone, you have to work at it, and empower the <a href="http://tummelvision.tv/guests/">tummlers</a> to maintain it. <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/006036.html">Teresa Nielsen-Hayden put it well</a>:<br /><blockquote><p>1. There can be no ongoing discourse without some degree of moderation, if only to kill off the hardcore trolls. It takes rather more moderation than that to create a complex, nuanced, civil discourse. If you want that to happen, you have to give of yourself. Providing the space but not tending the conversation is like expecting that your front yard will automatically turn itself into a garden.<p>2. Once you have a well-established online conversation space, with enough regulars to explain the local mores to newcomers, they’ll do a lot of the policing themselves.</blockquote><p>More <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/008856.html">from Teresa</a> and from <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/005024.html">John Scalzi</a>.<br /><p>The initial flavour of Google Plus, because it was seeded by Googlers and other geeky folk they invited, was like pre-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">Eternal September</a> Usenet - it had a cultural coherence because we were all geeks. As it grew to 25 million users, this could not hold. <p>Blogs deal with this by making it clear who the site owners are, and empowering them to manage commenters. Twitter does it by not showing you comments unless you chose to see the commenter, or if they address you directly. Google Plus is an uneasy hybrid of the two. <p>You can delete and block commenters on your postings, like a blog, and if you reshare someone's post, it starts a new comment thread, like a blog. However, anyone can @ or + your name and drag you into another comment thread via notification, and then you get notified of other follow-ups too, making griefing and harassment all too easy. <p>Enforcing 'common names' does nothing to help this; it just means your trolls and griefers will be using plausibly American-looking names that may or may not be their own, while <a href="http://my.nameis.me">those with unusual names</a>, will either be <a href="http://stilgherrian.com/only-one-name/right-google-you-stupid-cunts-this-is-simply-not-on/">excluded outright</a> or easily preyed on by the griefers reporting them, which is what I suspect happened to <a href="https://plus.google.com/105822688186016123722/posts/LWySptwhW7g">Violet Blue</a> tonight. <br /><p>Once you are suspended, the verification process is crude and manual, and also <a href="http://gewalker.blogspot.com/2011/08/firsthand-examination-of-google-profile.html">easily gamed</a>. Kellan <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/2011/07/23/cost-of-false-positives/">warned about this problem</a>:<blockquote><p>If you’ve never run a social software site … let me tell you: these kinds of <b>false positives are expensive.</b><p>They’re really expensive. They burn your most precious resources when running a startup: good will, and time. Your support staff has to address the issues (while people are yelling at them), your engineers are in the database mucking about with columns, until they finally break down about build an unbanning tool which inevitably doesn’t scale to really massive attacks, or new interesting attack vectors, which means you’re either back monkeying with the live databases or you’ve now got a team of engineers dedicated just to building tools to remediate false positives. And now you’re burning engineer cycles, engineering motivation (cleaning up mistakes sucks), staff satisfaction AND community good will. That’s the definition of expensive.<p>And this is all a TON of work.<p>And while this is all going down you’ve got another part of your company dedicated to making creating new accounts AS EASY AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. Which means when you do find and nuke a real spammer, they’re back in minutes. <b>So now you’re waging asymmetric warfare AGAINST YOURSELF.</b></blockquote><p>This is the hole Google is now in. A surprisingly large number of people I know, who've been discussing civilly online for years, have fallen foul of Vic's Procrustean name rules. When they point this out, they're harrassed by 'Real named' dickheads telling them to shut up and change their name, both in public and by being +-summoned by the trolls, and they have to find Google plus's well-hidden blocking tools rather quickly. Or give up and go elsewhere. <p>Now, Google has announced that <a href="https://plus.google.com/103618543375127073102/posts/ZiXUSJQ3fGA">they are verifying some people's names</a>, to prevent impersonation. Trouble is, they haven't said how . Twitter verifies celebrities <a href="http://support.twitter.com/groups/31-twitter-basics/topics/111-features/articles/119135-about-verified-accounts">via an opaque process.</a> Amazon does it by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=14279641#realname">checking your name matches a Credit Card</a>. <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=1229920">Google Search uses</a> rel="me" and rel="author" microformats. What Plus does is unknown. One of my <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/109581870574956225297">profiles is verified</a>, possibly because I went through the <a href="http://techpp.com/2010/02/12/get-your-google-buzz-profile-verified/">verification process</a> on <a href="http://knol.google.com/k/kevin-marks/-/3p1kpbd6uak81/0#">Google Knol</a> before. <p>This is also Identity theatre - Google saying 'trust us', rather than revealing the rel="me" link from the person's page that we already know. <p>Vic Gundotra needs to stop digging this hole. Scrap the normative 'common names' policy, add a coherent name verification and linked-site verification so we can tell the people we already know, and make moderation tools visible and available so we can curate the conversations ourselves. <p>With this, and an apology to those already ensnared by the existing process, he could maybe prevent Plus from being spoken of only alongside Wave and Knol.<br /><p>More on this:<ul><li><a href="http://my.nameis.me/">my.nameis.me</a> has testimonials on the nuances of names<br /><li><a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/08/nym-wars/">jwz is shocked by othering of the anonymous</a><br /><li>The EFF's <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/case-pseudonyms">case for pseudonyms</a><br /><li><a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2007/09/journalists-slumming-online.html">Journalists tempted by slumming</a></ul><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pnh/464975164/" title="Improved certificate by pnh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/464975164_e85cdddfc5.jpg" width="500" height="364" alt="Improved certificate"></a>

  <span class="p-name">David Cameron should heed Douglas Adams and ORG</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Widely <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/110811/p20#a110811p20">reported today</a> are David Cameron's <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/pm-statement-on-disorder-in-england/">comments to parliament</a> on riots and social media:<br /><blockquote>Mr Speaker, everyone watching these horrific actions will be stuck by how they were organised via social media.<br /><br />Free flow of information can be used for good. But it can also be used for ill.<br /><br />[And when people are using social media for violence we need to stop them.]<br /><br />So we are working with the Police, the intelligence services and industry to look at whether it would be right to stop people communicating via these websites and services when we know they are plotting violence, disorder and criminality.<br /><br />I have also asked the police if they need any other new powers.</blockquote>(the bit in square brackets was in his press statement, but not read in the Commons)<br /><br />This particular line of reasoning was magnificently rebutted by <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html">Douglas Adams in 1999</a>:<br /><blockquote>Newsreaders still feel it is worth a special and rather worrying mention if, for instance, a crime was planned by people 'over the Internet.' They don't bother to mention when criminals use the telephone or the M4, or discuss their dastardly plans 'over a cup of tea,' though each of these was new and controversial in their day.</blockquote><p>I was encouraged recently when the UK Govt <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14372698">abandoned web blocking plans</a> in the Digital Economy Act. Understanding that the internet is there for common carriage (a mere conduit, as the EU puts it) is important. Even on its own terms this threat makes little sense: if people are plotting riots on social media, that is surely exactly the evidence you need to convict them under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_%28crime%29#Statutory_offence">UK's statutory Conspiracy law</a>. The telephone, the M4 and cups of tea are much harder to use as sources of evidence.<br /><p>The Open Rights Group, has a <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2011/david-cameron">typically measured and thoughtful response</a> to this.<br /><p>Cameron should be careful, or he'll look to posterity like <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/01/fear-of-new-internet-tea-and-mapreduce.html">William Cobbett ranting</a> about the pernicious evils of tea.

  <span class="p-name">Should 'Money' be an adjective, not a noun?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I've been following Ben Laurie's <a href="http://www.links.org/?p=1164">thoughts</a> on <a href="http://www.links.org/?p=1175">Bitcoin</a> and now his <a href="http://www.links.org/files/distributed-currency.pdf">new paper</a> on <a href="http://www.links.org/?p=1183">An Efficient and Practical Distributed Currency</a>.<br /><p>He envisages a group of 'mintettes' that can agree on the distribution of coins, transfer them between individuals, and mint new ones, deciding between themselves how to distribute these. I like the idea of the different mintettes having different Public Good type ideas of where the newly created coins get assigned. The key here is to grow the coin supply at a rate that is lower than the growth of value held, so holders of your coinage get some appreciation, and distribute the new money to worthy causes, or to clients of that mintette.<br /><p>In effect you're doing an end run around Gresham's law, in the same way that the <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/10/04/130329523/how-fake-money-saved-brazil">Brazilian Real did</a> - and not how the US Govt is doing with <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/06/28/137394348/-1-billion-that-nobody-wants">dollar coins</a>. This is the bit that the <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/06/29/137478762/the-tuesday-podcast-libertarian-summer-camp">libertarian summer camp</a> got backwards - although they traded with gold, they set prices in US dollars.<br /><p>We do have a precedent for this, and it is an encouraging one. In effect, each company stock is a private currency. The success of Silicon Valley has been helped by the ability of companies here to mint this money-like stuff, and distribute it to stakeholders and investors alike. The difference is that they create new tranches of 'coins' at board meetings, though stock option vesting is a bit like the smooth currency growth that Bitcoin and Ben envisage. Again the goal is growing the money supply at a rate below demand, so that those holding it are rewarded.<br /><p>In effect we already have things that are more or less like currencies, and these new ones have some encouraging precedents.

  <span class="p-name">Plus Theory</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I wrote a post last year about Buzz theory, and the year before about <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html">Twitter theory</a>, so I thought I'd compare how Google+ (hereafter Plus) fits in with them too.<h3>Flow</h3><p>Plus is a <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/08/flow-past-web-even-better-than-realtime.html">flow</a> but it is re-ordered by responses to posts. It has a second flow of Notifications, that not only has an unread count (though it caps out at 9+), but that lurks atop every Google page, drawing you back in as you search or read gmail. What it chooses to notify you about are people who follow you (now mercifully collated into clumps, comments on your posts, and people plussing you (the equivalent of twitter @replies). Like Buzz, these Notifications end up privileged over the core flow, and also email you by default. <h3>Faces</h3><p>There are <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/05/faces-call-trust-code-in-our-brains.html">faces</a> of people next to each post, tapping into the subtle nuances of trust we all carry in our heads. The replies and notifications have smaller faces, which makes it harder to work out who they are, as this is where strangers show up more. The faces shown for the circle you're watching, or the list of people also in a limited post are very tiny indeed.<h3>Phatic</h3><p>The phatic feel of Twitter is partially there, but at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuThg91-4Nw">the launch</a> there was much talk of Google 'hiding the irrelevant' so the social gestures where we groom each other may be tidied away by an uncomprehending machine.<p>The replies from faceless strangers flooding your inbox if you respond to anyone with a large following will put people off interacting socially. The feeling of talking intimately to those you know is replaced by something closer to the 'naked in the school lunchroom' nightmare.<h3>Following</h3><p>Buzz does pick up Twitters asymmetric following model, and indeed adds a way to create private Buzzes for small groups, both key features. However, these are undermined by the confusing editing process. The Follower/Following editing is only in pop-up javascript dialogs on your <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&shva=1#buzz">Buzz in gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/me">Google Profile</a> pages, and because of the auto-follow onboarding, rather opaque. The groups editing is in <a href="http://">Google Contacts</a>, but that doesn't show the Followers, Following, Chat Friends, Latitude or other subgroups. There is also no way to see just conversations with those groups.<p>The overall effect makes it feel more like a <a href="http://kevan.org/morningtonia.pl?MC_On_The_Net">Mornington Crescent server</a> than Twitter. I made a <a href="http://">Mornington Crescent</a> Buzz account; it seems to fit.<h3>Publics</h3><p>Twitter's natural view is different for each of us, and is of those we have chosen. We each have our own public that we see and we address. <p>The subtlety is that the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">publics</a> are semi-overlapping - not everyone we can see will hear us, as they don't necessarily follow us, and they may not dip into the stream in time to catch the evanescent ripples in the flow that our remark started. To see responses to us from those we don't follow, we have to click the Mentions tab. However, as our view is of those we choose to follow, our emotional response is set by that, and we behave more civilly in return.<p>Buzz reverses this. The general comments from friends are in the Buzz tab, but anyone can use '@' to mention you, forcing the whole conversational thread into your inbox. Similarly, if you comment on someone else's Buzz, any further updates to the web show up in your main email inbox. The <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2004/11/06/the_tragedy_of_the_comments.php">tragedy of the comments</a> ensues, where <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/conferences/blog/2006/07/oscon_how_open_source_projects.html">annoying people</a> can take over the discussion, and their replies are privileged twice over those you choose to follow.<p>This is the <a href="http://xkcd.com/202/">YouTube comments problem</a> yet magnified; when all hear the words of one, the conversation often decays.<h3>Mutual media</h3><p>By bringing in Twitter,blogs, Google Reader shared items, photos and other Activity Streams feeds, Buzz has the potential to be a way to connect the loosely coupled flows those of us who live in the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/02/09/Information-Aristocracy">listening Web</a> to the email dwellers who may left behind. By each reading whom we choose to and passing on some of it to others, we are each others media, we are the synapses in the global brain of the web of thought and conversation. Although we each only touch a local part of it, ideas can travel a long way.<p>If the prioritisation of secondary commentary and poking over collated ideas can be reversed in Buzz, this could be made to work.<h3>Small world networks</h3><p>Social connections are a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Six-Degrees-Science-Connected-Market/dp/0393325423%3FSubscriptionId%3D1K3HRANMNP9TFHJC9282%26tag%3Depeusepigone-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0393325423">small-world network</a> locally strongly-connected, but spreading globally in a small number of jumps. The email graph that Buzz taps into may be a worse <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/11/29/attention_netwo.html">model</a> of real world social networks that articulated SNS's like Facebook, but it could be improved if the following and editing models are fixed.<p>Buzz's promise is that it builds on <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/dclinton/XxER6oP4WGe/The-best-way-to-get-a-sense-of-where-the-Buzz-API">other open standards</a>, so it could help encourage others to do this better.

  This week, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are threatening us with an armed raid, like that <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110424/ap_on_hi_te/us_wi_fi_warning">on an innocent Buffalo household</a> if we dont password-protect our WiFi:<br /><blockquote>It was 6:20 a.m. March 7 when he and his wife were awakened by the sound of someone breaking down their rear door. He threw a robe on and walked to the top of the stairs, looking down to see seven armed people with jackets bearing the initials I-C-E, which he didn't immediately know stood for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.<br />"They are screaming at him, 'Get down! Get down on the ground!' He's saying, 'Who are you? Who are you?'" Covert [his lawyer] said.<br />"One of the agents runs up and basically throws him down the stairs, and he's got the cuts and bruises to show for it," said Covert, who said the homeowner plans no lawsuit. When he was allowed to get up, agents escorted him and watched as he used the bathroom and dressed.</blockquote>This response was because they assumed he'd downloaded child pornography. <br /><blockquote>Law enforcement officials say the case is a cautionary tale. Their advice: Password-protect your wireless.</blockquote>

  <p>A while back I <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/06/badgering-beeb.html">complained</a> that the BBC's parochial attitude that was making <a href="http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2006/05/what-bears-do-on-lawn.html">Neil Gaiman furtively obtain Doctor Who</a> - expat fans were being treated like Madame de Pompadour in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Girl-in-the-Fireplace/dp/B003NQG5PC?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969">The Girl in the Fireplace</a>, only getting the Doctor on DVD, after waiting long enough to die.<p>They solved this problem for Neil by having him write <a href="http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/SuperGamer/news/?a=35849">The Doctor's Wife</a>, so he gets to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96fgOz0uDzs#t=24m57s">carry round the series on a flash key</a>. It almost seemed like the BBC got the message, boasting in the New York Times that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/arts/television/doctor-who-us-premiere-will-not-be-delayed.html">US premiere will not be delayed</a>. But that was like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Complete-Matt-Smith/dp/B003EV6DBM?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969">promise to Amelia Pond</a> that they'd be right back, while we pay iTunes or Amazon for the new series, and are left sitting on our suitcase in our nightie and wellies, while nothing downloads for us.<p>Instead, because they <a href="http://twitter.theinfo.org/62111099989921792">fret archaically about TV ratings</a>, we're supposed to wait 13 hours after the UK sees it, and then, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Complete-David-Tennant/dp/B000JBWWP6?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969">Rose</a> in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Complete-David-Tennant/dp/B001DJ7PQ4?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969">Journey's End</a>, we're stuck in a parallel universe with a pale imitation of the Doctor - BBC America's letterboxed, pillarboxed, advertisement-infested, scenes-cut-for-time version that I truly hope Steven Moffat, Russell Davies, Neil Gaiman, and everyone else who worked so hard to imagine these adventures for us, never gets to see. It's like the Dream Lord from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amys-Choice/dp/B003PZEF0S?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969">Amy's Choice</a> seized control of the Tardis from us.<p>So what can we do? We can be like River Song in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Sixth-Part-1/dp/B004QOB8QG?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969">Impossible Astronaut</a>, and fly the Tardis properly, sweetly warn of spoilers, and get the episode from BitTorrent instead.<p>If the BBC were smart about this, they'd offer the diehard fans a pay-to-download package that started downloading during the UK première TV showing. If they were even smarter they'd charge a super premium to get access the same time they do the press previews the week before. <br /><p>RIP <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SyN3zngs68">Elisabeth Sladen</a>, like us fans in the 90s, dropped off in the wrong place, with just memories and a bad robot dog to keep us going, but we held out hope and saw the Doctor again.

  <span class="p-name">Ev's identity map ignores what we say</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://twitter.com/ev">Ev Williams</a> wrote a good <a href="http://evhead.com/2011/04/five-easy-pieces-of-online-identity.html">blog post on identity</a> yesterday, that I suggest you go and read. The odd thing is that he leaves out the publicly articulated thoughts that we use blogs, Twitter and other services to publish as an expression of our identity. Before I get to that, though, I'd like to connect his facets back to the open specs that represent these aspects.<br /><h4>Authentication</h4><p>Ev mentions <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> here, and is essentially correct that it is not helpful on its own. It was designed to verify URLs for blog comments. If all you do is use OpenID, you just replace logging into your site with logging into another, adding extra confusion without much benefit. However, once you have a URL for someone, you can then discover further information about them, by examining that URL and its links. <a href="http://microformats.org/about">Microformats</a> can encode this directly in the webpage, or you can use related links to discover API endpoints for more.<p>The distinction between Authorization and Authentication is elided by Ev, and in practice <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> has been winning out over OpenID as it is explicitly an Authorization APi that had Authentication as a side effect. The new <a href="http://openidconnect.com/">OpenID Connect</a> proposals try to remedy both these failing by using OAuth and by standardizing on how to list other endpoints.<br /><h4>Representation</h4><p>Here Ev is looking for what is commonly called profile information. We have some mature standards for this - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">vCard</a> is widely used by email clients, and is currently going through another standardization round to add modern features. The <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard microformat</a> gives a simple way to embed profiles in web pages. Also, the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me">rel="me"</a> part of <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/xfn">XFN</a> makes it straightforward to link web pages together that represent different aspects fo your public representation. This is supported by Facebook, Twitter and Google, but sadly not by about.me whom Ev praises.<p>If you want a general data format for profile data, <a href="http://portablecontacts.net/">Portable Contacts</a> is what you need.<br /><h4>Communication</h4><p>Ev's emphasis on email addresses here illustrates the problem with them; they are <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/01/urls-are-people-too.html">primarily write-only</a>; though we persist in using them for log-in IDs, they are not readily discoverable. The <a href="http://webfinger.org/">WebFinger</a> spec gives a way round this - a way to go from an email to endpoints for other readable identity standards. Other communication standards have piggy-backed on email address, such as Jabber and Wave.<br /><h4>Personalization</h4><p>This hints at the glaring gap in Ev's model, the expression of personal taste and preference. This is commonly done by reviewing, and we have the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview">hReview microformat</a> to express that, but it can also be useful just to track a history of media played or places visited to derive preferences over time. Here <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> are an obvious fit, and it would be good to map such proprietary formats as Amazon purchases, Last.fm scrobbles, iTunes played songs and so on into a common format to derive this. <p>One model we can use for this is tagging - associating keywords with things. Many feed specs have tagging built in, and the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag">rel="tag" microformat</a> is a way of indicating these publicly.<br /><h4>Reputation</h4><p>As Ev says, this is problematic, and also often highly contextual; I may trust someone's advice on restaurants without listening to them about which programming language to use. Reputation and trust are subtle, deeply human and very hard to model. The best answer here may be to rely on the power of faces and following; if we attach the face of someone we know to their public statements, we can decide for ourselves how much weight to give them.<br><br /><p>Which brings me back to my opening point. When we decide who to pay attention to online, we tend to rely on what they say; if you get an @ reply on twitter, clicking on that person's name to see their most recent comments is hugely useful in deciding how much attention to pay to them. Similarly, the history of public blog posts, or their reviews of movies, music, books or restaurants arre other reasons we may follow them, and our identity is most strongly formed from the stories we tell and retell about ourselves. Feeds, whether in Atom, RSS or <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom">hAtom</a>, and Activity Streams give rich representation of our thought, opinions and actions.<br /><p>Whom we choose to associate with or follow is also an expression of our identity, and a useful signal when deciding how much attention to pay to someone, and XFN and Portable Contacts are both usefule in discovering these connections.<br /><p><a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2011/04/09/UnderstandingOnlineIdentityInThePostWeb20World.aspx">Dare Obasanjo also responded</a> to Ev's Identity post, and added in payment as well as the friends as missed aspects. I'd love to discuss this further with both Ev and Dare at the <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/iiw-12/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> next month, which is where many of the specs mentioned above were conceived and agreed. Maybe Ev can bring some others from Twitter with him too; their past contributions to OAuth were highly useful and there is plenty more to get our teeth into, as Ev's post shows.

  <span class="p-name">Twitter Theory applied to Quora</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Previously I've written about <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html">social theories that help me understand Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2010/02/twitter-theory-applied-to-google-buzz.html">applied them to Google Buzz</a>, so I though I'd see how <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> fits in this framework.<br /><h3>Flow</h3><p><a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> is not naturally a <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/08/flow-past-web-even-better-than-realtime.html">flow</a>, it's a discussion, but the login page does show a series of events for you. Unlike Twitter, it does present unread counts, which start off as calls to action, but become yet another annoying to-do list as the numbers mount up.<br /><h3>Faces</h3><p>There are <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/05/faces-call-trust-code-in-our-brains.html">faces</a> shown by the answers, but they are too small to tap fully into the subtle nuances of trust we all carry in our heads. The larger ones in the 'people you may know' column work better, but this depersonalization may be deliberate on Quora's part as it tries to make the site more 'objective'.<br /><h3>Phatic</h3><p>The site admins are actively suppressing phatic use of Quora, with interventions to mark emotional or conversational comment as 'not helpful' (unless they are conversations about how the answer should be rewritten, as @Mona <a href="https://img.skitch.com/20110103-bi9hqxqmwtycfr4gxn18xp2dc9.jpg">found</a> <a href="https://img.skitch.com/20110103-bi9hqxqmwtycfr4gxn18xp2dc9.jpg">out</a>). Maybe upvoting is a phatic act, or giving out topics playfullly, but it is against the declared spirit of Quora to use it this way.<br /><h3>Following</h3><p>Buzz does pick up Twitters asymmetric following model, and indeed adds a way to create private Buzzes for small groups, both key features. However, these are undermined by the confusing editing process. The Follower/Following editing is only in pop-up javascript dialogs on your <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&shva=1#buzz">Buzz in gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/me">Google Profile</a> pages, and because of the auto-follow onboarding, rather opaque. The groups editing is in <a href="http://">Google Contacts</a>, but that doesn't show the Followers, Following, Chat Friends, Latitude or other subgroups. There is also no way to see just conversations with those groups.<p>The overall effect makes it feel more like a <a href="http://kevan.org/morningtonia.pl?MC_On_The_Net">Mornington Crescent server</a> than Twitter. I made a <a href="http://">Mornington Crescent</a> Buzz account; it seems to fit.<h3>Publics</h3><p>Twitter's natural view is different for each of us, and is of those we have chosen. We each have our own public that we see and we address. <p>The subtlety is that the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">publics</a> are semi-overlapping - not everyone we can see will hear us, as they don't necessarily follow us, and they may not dip into the stream in time to catch the evanescent ripples in the flow that our remark started. To see responses to us from those we don't follow, we have to click the Mentions tab. However, as our view is of those we choose to follow, our emotional response is set by that, and we behave more civilly in return.<p>Buzz reverses this. The general comments from friends are in the Buzz tab, but anyone can use '@' to mention you, forcing the whole conversational thread into your inbox. Similarly, if you comment on someone else's Buzz, any further updates to the web show up in your main email inbox. The <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2004/11/06/the_tragedy_of_the_comments.php">tragedy of the comments</a> ensues, where <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/conferences/blog/2006/07/oscon_how_open_source_projects.html">annoying people</a> can take over the discussion, and their replies are privileged twice over those you choose to follow.<p>This is the <a href="http://xkcd.com/202/">YouTube comments problem</a> yet magnified; when all hear the words of one, the conversation often decays.<h3>Mutual media</h3><p>By bringing in Twitter,blogs, Google Reader shared items, photos and other Activity Streams feeds, Buzz has the potential to be a way to connect the loosely coupled flows those of us who live in the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/02/09/Information-Aristocracy">listening Web</a> to the email dwellers who may left behind. By each reading whom we choose to and passing on some of it to others, we are each others media, we are the synapses in the global brain of the web of thought and conversation. Although we each only touch a local part of it, ideas can travel a long way.<p>If the prioritisation of secondary commentary and poking over collated ideas can be reversed in Buzz, this could be made to work.<h3>Small world networks</h3><p>Social connections are a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Six-Degrees-Science-Connected-Market/dp/0393325423%3FSubscriptionId%3D1K3HRANMNP9TFHJC9282%26tag%3Depeusepigone-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0393325423">small-world network</a> locally strongly-connected, but spreading globally in a small number of jumps. The email graph that Buzz taps into may be a worse <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/11/29/attention_netwo.html">model</a> of real world social networks that articulated SNS's like Facebook, but it could be improved if the following and editing models are fixed.<p>Buzz's promise is that it builds on <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/dclinton/XxER6oP4WGe/The-best-way-to-get-a-sense-of-where-the-Buzz-API">other open standards</a>, so it could help encourage others to do this better.

  Today the w3c launched an <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/">HTML5 logo</a>, that includes sub-logos for different technologies included in or associated with the standard.

  <span class="p-name">Two faces of Android</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>The most remarkable thing about Android is that it is the first widely adopted Open Source client operating system. It's long been clear that Open Source is the best way to preserve infrastructural code from the vicissitudes of corporate and governmental volatility, but using it for client applications has so far not taken off as well. There has often been a separation between an open source underlying layer and a proprietary user experience that is built atop it.<p>Android does follow this pattern to some extent - the underlying OS code is fully Open Source under an Apache License, so anyone can bend it to their own uses, but in order to get the "with Google" logo on your device, you need to <a href="http://source.android.com/compatibility/overview.html">conform</a> to Google's <a href="http://source.android.com/compatibility/android-2.3-cdd.pdf">Compatibility Definition Document</a>. That has changed over time; for example the <a href="http://source.android.com/compatibility/android-2.1-cdd.pdf">2.1 version specifies that your device MUST have a camera</a> and 1.6 requires telephony.<p>If you do this, you might then get access to what I call the top half of Android - the closed source Google apps that integrate the device closely with their web services - Contacts, GMail, Talk, Android Market, Google Maps, Navigation, Listen, Earth, Places and so on. However, this requires an explicit partnership with Google.<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmarks/5324400539/" title="Android Cambrian Explosion by Kevin Marks, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5008/5324400539_026f313440.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Android Cambrian Explosion" /></a> <br /><p>The fascinating thing here is that there is already a Cambrian Explosion of new Android devices going on in China and India. You can buy iPad lookalikes, things that look like a huge iPod, TV-based video game systems and more that run Android, <a href="http://www.bigboxstore.com/computers/android-tablet-pcs">often for under $100</a>. I fully expect most digital photo frames and mp3 players being built this year will end up running some form of Android, with cameras following on too. <p>This means that more and more devices will be naturally web-connected, able to run browsers, and to plug into web publishing ecosystems naturally - the Android <code>Intent</code> model means that Apps can plug together neatly, and replace system features if desired. <p>However, a lot of the day-to day utility of an Android device is in the proprietary, partners-only layer - that you only get after doing a business development deal with Google of some kind. What we will start to see is alternatives for these Applications being developed. To some extent we're already seeing this from US carriers, but I think this year we'll see both an Open Source suite of apps to swap in many of these functions, and other proprietary offerings to compete with the Google upper half. <p>Who could build such a suite? Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft clearly have most of the necessary pieces, but how about Baidu, Tencent, Vkontakte or other companies with strong regional ties? <p>Now we have a truly Open consumer OS, a world of possibilities open up.

  <span class="p-name">Firesheep, enterprise software and other broken models</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>There has been a lot of fuss about <a href="http://codebutler.com/firesheep">FireSheep</a>, a browser plugin that show how easy it is to intercept packets on the internet, and masquerade as someone else. The idea is nothing new: <a href="http://www.etherpeg.org">EtherPeg</a>—which intercepts wifi traffic and <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/1414.html">shows the JPEGs and other images passing by</a>—is over 10 years old. Annalee Newitz wrote a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.06/dating.html?pg=4">Wired story on people packet sniffing in coffee shops back in 2004</a>. <br /><p>The underlying design of the internet means that you don't know who will be able to see any packets you send. If you care about not being snooped on, you need an encrypted connection from your computer to the one serving you at the other end. The best way to do this on the web is to use HTTPS, which all browsers support, and most servers support with configuration changes. It's not perfect, but it's good enough.<br /><p>However, much of the advice following on from FireSheep was misleading or outright wrong. I saw <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9193201/How_to_protect_against_Firesheep_attacks">several</a> articles <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/28/firesheep-vpns/">saying</a>: <ul><li>Avoid Open WiFi<br /><li>Turn on WPA encryption<br /><li>Use a VPN to tunnel the traffic into a server elsewhere</ul><p>These techniques may protect for a while against those nearby you in the Café, but by not securing the whole connection, they just change who is able to intercept your communications. <p>The security model here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29">firewall</a> one - the notion that there are trusted networks and untrusted networks, and as long as you're inside a trusted one, you'll be OK. This is an obsolete worldview. When computers were large fixed physical entities with software controlled by a specialist, and networks were wires under their control too, this had some correspondence with reality, but it was always tenuous - others within the firewall could be running compromised machines; outbound connections could still leak data. <p>If you VPN into a company or service to mask your outbound connections, that endpoint is an attractive point of attack, as it has collected a set of people who think their data needs securing. There's a clear example of this in this NYT article about a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/magazine/14Hacker-t.html">hacker who lured his friends to use an FBI VPN</a> to track them down and arrest them. <p>This worldview connects with two other themes. The US Government is <a href="http://scrawford.net/blog/calea-ii-why-is-it-needed/1411/">trying to pass a law</a> requiring ISPs to enable your communications to be intercepted. The UK government is also <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2010/misinformation-about-mass-surveillance">working on legislation</a> on retaining all email and web traffic. Similarly, many companies monitor internet traffic within and leaving their secure networks for legal compliance and employee monitoring. Such mandated backdoors, like the VPN tunnel, become attractive targets for other bad actors - remember the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_telephone_tapping_case_2004-2005">Greek government being spied on</a> through a legally mandated interception backdoor in the phones they used? <p>This week, I spent a couple of days at the <a href="http://www.e2conf.com/">Enterprise 2.0 conference</a>, hearing how open standards like <a href="http://activitystrea.ms">Activity Streams</a> and <a href="http://opensocial.org">OpenSocial</a> are being used to bridge separate business information systems both within and between companies, with <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> used to enforce corporate policy.<p>This seems anathema to old-line IT managers who assume that they dictate who gets to see what, but the pragmatic realisation that many business people have more powerful and connected computing devices in their pockets as phones than on their desks from corporate IT was in evidence at E2.0 at least.<iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=epeusepigone-20&o=1&p=8&l=bpl&asins=159184357X&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="align:left;padding-top:5px;width:131px;height:245px;padding-right:10px;"align="left" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>This brought to mind the great conversation we had with <a href="http://tummelvision.tv/2010/11/06/41-josh-klein-hacking-work/">Josh Klein on TummelVision</a> last week, discussing his book Hacking Work - breaking stupid rules for smart results:<blockquote>one of the most common hacks we found: jumping IT’s firewall and working around their restrictions and tools in open computing environments, then bringing the work back over the firewall and presenting it to bosses as if the corporate tools had actually been used.</blockquote><p>Ben Horowitz's <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/13/new-enterprise-customer/">article on enterprise sales</a> in TechCrunch today tries to justify corporate practices, even as he recognizes the inversion of the innovation flow.<p>What this misses is the underlying economic justification for the existence of a corporation in the first place - the economic theories that build on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm">Coase's work</a> saying that firms exist because transaction costs are lower within them than external transactions mediated by the marketplaces. Pettifogging internal purchasing rules should be subject to this test: does the internal transaction cost of approving and purchasing something exceed the value of the thing being purchased? <p>Reading Ben's explanation of how corporate salespeople help institutions negotiate their own labyrinthine processes, I couldn't help but be reminded of <a href="http://edgeperspectives.typepad.com/edge_perspectives/2010/11/2010-shift-index-passion-and-performance.html">John Hagel's Big Shift</a> model, (also <a href="http://tummelvision.tv/2010/06/14/john-hagel-tummelvision-ep-22/">discussed on TummelVision</a>), which continues to show a declining return on assets for corporations. <p>The challenge we have on the web is to maintain the kinds of open-to-all interoperable standards that empower us to work round these creaking bureaucracies. If we delegate our online identities to a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704635704575604993311538482.html">few firms</a> operating proprietary APIs, that they can revoke access to, or <a href="http://searchengineland.com/facebook-you-have-no-right-to-export-email-addresses-55247">decide who can call them for reasons of corporate strategy</a>, the lowered transaction costs suddenly get very high again.<p>Doc Searls's work on <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page">VRM</a> (<a href="http://tummelvision.tv/2010/11/12/tummelvision-42-doc-searls/">this week's TummelVision</a>) is all about making sure that we can retain agency over our own information. I expect to discuss this in depth at <a href="http://defragcon.com/2010/DEFRAG10-Agenda.htm">Defrag next week</a>.

  <span class="p-name">Geek Cinema: 'The Social Network' vs 'The Man in the White Suit'</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I recently watched a film that dramatically evoked the disruption caused by geeky inventors, the difficulties they have getting funded, and the forces that combine to oppose them in the name of the status quo.<p>Sadly, this wasn't at last night's showing of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/">The Social Network</a>, but watching the 1951 Ealing comedy <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044876/">The Man In The White Suit</a> on my phone while flying home.<p>The Social Network has zinging dialogue, tilt-shift rowing at Henley, and has lawyers as its most sympathetic characters. Most of its humour comes from heavy-handed prefiguring of Facebook's eventual success; clearly you can't spoil the ending, so the trailer just recaps the whole film:<br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/lB95KLmpLR4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/lB95KLmpLR4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br />The opening hacking scene, dramatized almost verbatim from <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2178939/entry/2178940/">Zuckerberg's blog at the time</a>, is perhaps the best 'using a computer' scene in a movie yet - Mark should get a screenwriting credit. But the mythical girlfriend who dumped him and his reactions to that - 'cyberbullying', seeking fame, plaintively hitting refresh on the friend request - that frame the film are a disappointing narrative touch that duck the chance to try to explain his real motivation. Apart from the lawyer, all the women in this film are purely sex objects - when Zuck is asked 'What are the girls going to do?' and replies 'Nothing', that's clearly Sorkin talking.<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FMAV?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00006FMAV"><img border="0" style="float: right;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CQWWVHA6L._SL160_.jpg"></a>In contrast, The Man in the White Suit has Alec Guinness inventing a monomolecular fibre that can't break and naturally repels dirt. To do this he has to get to work into labs at textile factories under false pretenses, and when he eventually succeeds, provokes a hostile reaction from both the factory owners and the unionized employees, who want to suppress his work. If you haven't seen it, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FMAV?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00006FMAV">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/The-Man-in-the-White-Suit/60029976">Netflix</a> have it.<p>Here, the motivation to invent something new and exciting is expressed well, and the technology behind it is plausibly explained. Guinness inspires Joan Greenwood with his idea, and she researches it and champions him to get his work funded. The women in this sixty-year-old film are well-drawn characters, with motivations of their own. They are peers and colleagues to Guinness's Stanley, not sex objects; indeed that is directly challenged. The film is stronger and more emotionally powerful for it.<p>Both films capture the ascetic geek intensity and focus well, but Sorkin and Fincher want to tear it down, whereas MacDougal and MacKendrick see the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business-Essentials/dp/0060521996&tag=epeusepigone-20">Innovators Dilemma</a> clearly 45 years before Christensen did. As <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/78081/sorkin-zuckerberg-the-social-network">Lessig says</a>, The Social Network portrays a legal system that preys on invention, not supporting it; the Man in the White Suit has the inventor's notebooks establishing rights that he needs to be paid for.<p>Conversely, to get his invention out to people, Stanley needs to convince the very industry he is disrupting to adopt it, whereas the existence of the Internet and it's open protocols mean that Zuckerberg was able to get his idea adopted by thousands with a small loan from a friend.<p> Technology has made a lot of progress in 60 years, but judging by this new film, law and women's roles have gone backwards.

  <span class="p-name">The Slutsky vanishes - Google Instant has a smutty mind</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>At the Google Instant Launch on Wednesday, I ran into my former colleague, the writer and internet famous video star Irina Slutsky. We sat together, and so naturally when we were trying out Google Instant during the launch, I tried typing her name in. And an odd thing happened - Google whited out the Instant search results.<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/irinaslutsky/3402397316/" title="you better recognize by irina slutsky, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3597/3402397316_d334b411f2.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="you better recognize"></a><p><a href="http://adage.com/digitalnext/post?article_id=145855">Irina asked about this</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0eMHRxlJ2c#t=61m05s">Johanna Wright of Google replied</a> that they white out some words related to sex and hate speech, in case inappropriate results appeared for people who weren't expecting it. 'Slut' is one of these words, but it is not clear at all why 'Slutsky' is. <p>I already wrote about my concerns that Google's predictive words could narrow the range of searched-for terms into clichés - that as you type Google, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/18/the_right_ones_in_the_right_order">in Stoppard's words</a>, is <blockquote><p>announcing every stale revelation of the newly enlightened, like stout Cortez coming upon the Pacific — war is profits, politicians are puppets, Parliament is a farce, justice is a fraud, property is theft… It’s all here: the Stock Exchange, the arms dealers, the press barons… You can’t fool Brodie — patriotism is propaganda, religion is a con trick, royalty is an anachronism… Pages and pages of it. It’s like being run over very slowly by a travelling freak show of favourite simpletons, the India rubber pedagogue, the midget intellectual, the human panacea…</blockquote><p>At least these suggestions are based on integrating over the text of the web; the words that get the silent whiteout treatment seem to have been chosen by a committee though, and clearly an American one at that, as it whites out 'ass' but not 'arse, 'shit' but not 'shite', 'slut' but not 'slag' and so on (I didn't type every smutty British slang word in, life is too short). <p>However, the modern-day Bowdlers at Google don't white you out based on what you type, but on what they predict you're going to type.</p><p>If I type 'blue-footed' - it predicts I'm typing 'blue-foooted booby' and as 'boobies' is an Official Google Smutty Word, my search goes white (in fact 'blue-foo' is enough).<p>Similarly, typing 'turn again d' implies 'turn again Dick Whittington', and 'dick' is a an Official Google Smutty Word. <p> The same is true for Irina -so shocking is her last name that all you have to type is 'irina sl' and the Google whiteout erases her from results. <p>Weirdly, if you type 'who killed cock' it is completed to 'who killed cock-robin' with a hyphen inserted, which implies someone has edited the auto-complete list manually. <p>My worldview and sense of appropriateness is probably close enough to Google's committee that I'm not going to be too bothered by this, but I do wonder about them deciding what the norms of speech are for everyone in the world.

  <span class="p-name">If Google predicts your future, will it be a cliché?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/000654102X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=epeusepigone-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=000654102X"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M2mnGYI2L._SL160_.jpg" style="float: right;" border="0" /></a><br />I wonder if Michael Frayn saw the launch of <a href="http://scribe.googlelabs.com/">Google Scribe</a> today, and smiled to himself. In 1965, Frayn wrote a book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/000654102X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=epeusepigone-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=000654102X"><cite>The Tin Men</cite></a>, which featured a mechanism that wrote newspaper articles by joining together clichéd phrases through a small number of rules.</p><p> There's an explanatory extract from it in <a href="http://www.everypoet.org/pffa/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9930#post64902">this discussion of why you should avoid clichés when writing Poetry</a>.<p>George Orwell, in <a href="http://www.resort.com/%7Eprime8/Orwell/patee.html"><cite>Politics and the English Language</cite></a>, described this way of writing:<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375415033?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375415033"><img border="0" style="float: right;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DV8DZ6CAL._SL160_.jpg"></a><blockquote><p>As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug. The attraction of this way of writing is that it is easy. It is easier—even quicker, once you have the habit—to say “In my opinion it is not an unjustifiable assumption that” than to say “I think”. If you use ready-made phrases, you not only don't have to hunt about for the words; you also don't have to bother with the rhythms of your sentences since these phrases are generally so arranged as to be more or less euphonious. When you are composing in a hurry—when you are dictating to a stenographer, for instance, or making a public speech—it is natural to fall into a pretentious, Latinized style. Tags like “a consideration which we should do well to bear in mind” or ”a conclusion to which all of us would readily assent” will save many a sentence from coming down with a bump.</p></blockquote><p>Clearly, Google Scribe has been trained on the vast corpus of English language text that is also used for Google Translate to come up with plausible sentence fragments. Equally clearly, that means it is bound to be plucking phrases that have been written before out of the web for you, and favouring those that have been said most often. It won't come up with a crisp, resoundingly clear phrase for you, unless it has already been said many times before.</p><p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100908-b67bche2ahcnuh9u5qjrfrgn88.jpg" alt="Orwellian" /></p><p>The most likely words to follow “clocks were” now, according to Google, are “striking thirteen”. I hope Orwell would appreciate the irony.</p><p> Now, this is amusing in itself, but it is also indicative of a wider problem. If you've done much web searching for, say, home maintenance tips, you'll see a lot of prose that has either been written by a machine of this type, or by poorly paid human writers who use a very similar compositional process. We have a kind of mutated Turing Test going on all around us, where robotic writers are trying to convince robotic readers that they are human, and their stilted prose is worth presenting to the real people searching. Of course, the robots are searching too, to get the source material that is fed into their word mills to create this shambling facsimile of human prose.</p><p> It may be impressive that computers can now write bad prose like so many people do, but I do wonder about <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2010/09/googles-schmidts-odd-vision-of-the-future-of-search/62582/">Eric Schmidt's grand vision</a> of Google predicting what we will want to do before we think of it ourselves. Will it in fact be what we wanted, or will it be a mishmash of expected behaviours, that we'll <a href="http://www.inspirationandchai.com/Regrets-of-the-Dying.html">regret on our deathbeds</a>?</p><blockquote><p>1. I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.</p><p>This was the most common regret of all. When people realise that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled.</p></blockquote><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0571197515?ie=UTF8&tag=epeusepigone-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0571197515"><img border="0" style="float: right;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419xXSmtDPL._SL160_.jpg"></a><p>A scene in <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/18/the_right_ones_in_the_right_order">Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing</a> sums this up well:</p><blockquote><p>He’s a lout with language. I can’t help somebody who thinks, or thinks he thinks, that editing a newspaper is censorship, or that throwing bricks is a demonstration while building tower blocks is social violence, or that unpalatable statement is provocation while disrupting the speaker is the exercise of free speech… Words don’t deserve that kind of malarkey. They’re innocent, neutral, precise, standing for this, describing that, meaning the other, so if you look after them you can build bridges across incomprehension and chaos. But when they get their corners knocked off, they’re no good any more, and Brodie knocks corners off without knowing he’s doing it. So everything he writes is jerry-built. It’s rubbish. An intelligent child could push it over. I don’t think writers are sacred, but words are. They deserve respect. If you get the right ones in the right order, you can nudge the world a little or make a poem which children will speak for you when you’re dead.</p></blockquote><p>People are used to typing questions into a box on Google and getting a machine's suggestions. Increasingly though, they're typing emotions into a box on Twitter or Facebook, and getting a human response instead.</p>

  <span class="p-name">Welcome Apple, seriously</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Yesterday's update of iTunes added <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/ping/">Ping</a>, a music-focused social network. When I tried it out early in the evening, it had Facebook Connect enabled, and both imported friends from Facebook, and notified me when new ones joined. Shortly afterwards, <a href="http://c.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZConnections.woa/wa/viewProfile?userId=172394997">Mark Zuckerberg joined</a>, and shortly after that the Facebook connection was missing.<br />This morning, neither company is talking on the record, though <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20100902/facebook-blocked-api-access-to-ping-after-failure-to-strike-agreement-so-apple-removed-feature-after-launch/">Kara Swisher reports</a> that Steve Jobs complained about 'onerous terms' from Facebook.<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/2592742563/" title="Supernova by psd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3101/2592742563_5e96da5494_m.jpg" width="240" height="188" alt="Supernova" style="float: right" /></a> This naturally reminds me of the problems we had with <a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2008/05/how-google-friend-connect-works.html">Google Friend Connect</a>, where Facebook's accusation of a ToS violation was never backed up by an explanation of what would not violate the terms, leading to the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/06/17/not-so-social-google-and-facebook-face-off-at-supernova/">"Data Roach Motel" accusations at Supernova</a>. The underlying issue is whether you should give another company veto power over your application. Last time I wrote on this, it was <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2010/06/steve-jobs-and-curates-egg.html">Apple's veto</a> I was warning about, though at the same time Apple was trying to avoid giving Adobe veto power over their platform again.<p> The thing is, we have been round this <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/12/cycling-to-new-layers-of-freedom.html">cycle</a> before, and the answer is known too - the way to interoperate with another company without having to have a business agreement with them is to use <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/05/api-is-bespoke-suit-standard-is-t-shirt.html">open standards, not proprietary APIs</a>.<p> Apple knows this - they have helped lead development of HTML5 and WebKit, along with many other standards in the past, including podcasting and MPEG4. Facebook knows this too, and they have been strong supporters of OAuth and Activity Streams, and even of Portable Contacts, when it's them doing the importing.<p> Clearly it good for us as users to be able to delegate our contact lists to an existing source - this weeks launch of conference sharing site <a href="http://lanyrd.com">Lanyrd</a> shows that. It's also in our interests to be able to propagate the actions of playing, liking and purchasing music, videos and anything else between sites of our choosing, so that we can share with our friends, and so we can get more useful recommendations for the future (at minimum, not suggesting things we already have).<p> This was the core of the discussion at the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_CRM_2010">VRM Workshop</a> last week in Boston - that we should control over who sees what about us, and I think that with these common standards we can solve both problems - the individuals get to save having to re-enter their information everywhere, and control what flows to where, and the companies get the ability to interoperate without bizdev and single source lock-in. <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> (and the <a href="http://prezi.com/c2hwhoqdmlfj/social-web-standards/">associated standards they build on</a>) are our best hope for this.

  <span class="p-name">Steve Jobs and the Curate's Egg</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>The word 'curation' has become popular recently in the tech world to describe what I call mutual media - the way, by reading many things and passing on a few of them, that we mediate the world of information for each other. As <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2010/06/06/on-the-internet-sometimes-people-do-know-youre-a-dog/">m'colleague JP Rangaswami</a> says, "Curators add to relevance by stripping away the irrelevant and the unneeded and the shoddy."<p>However, there is a move to co-opt this useful term into a new form of centralised control. <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/sarah_rotman_epps/10-05-14-curated_computing_designing_for_the_post_ipad_era">Sarah Rotman of Forrester</a> defines 'curated computing' as:<blockquote>A mode of computing where <b>choice is constrained to deliver less complex, more relevant</b> experiences.</blockquote>Given Forrester's background, expect this 'curated computing' idea to be used to justify IT departments preventing corporate users from using applications they choose any day now.<p>At the D Conference last week, <a href="http://video.allthingsd.com/video/d8-steve-jobs-onstage-full-length-video/70F7CC1D-FFBF-4BE0-BFF1-08C300E31E11">Steve Jobs embraced this term</a>, referring to a 'curated app store'.<p>This definition moves the idea of curation from democratic to hierarchical - our choice becomes take it or leave it. As Jobs said <blockquote>Things are packages, of emphasis. Some things are emphasised in a product, some things are not done as well in a product, some things are chosen not to be done at all in a product.</blockquote><br />This reminds me of the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate's_egg">'Curate's Egg' cartoon</a>:<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/True_humility.png"/><br />Bishop: "I'm afraid you've got a bad egg, Mr Jones"; <br />Curate: "Oh, no, my Lord, I assure you that parts of it are excellent!"<br /><p>When choosing what features go into Apple Products, of course Jobs gets to decide this; it is indeed a great skill. However, when offering technology platforms for others to build businesses on, this is more problematic.<p>While talking about Flash on the iPad, Jobs said:<blockquote>A more popular developer environment was HyperCard, we were OK to axe that[...] Hypercard was huge in it's day because it was accessible to anybody</blockquote><p>Indeed it was - many people miss it; <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/03/the-ipad-needs-its-hypercard.html">Dale Dougherty says he wants a HyperCard for the iPad</a>. I don't think he does.<p><a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/5155">When Steve Jobs's Apple cancelled the HyperCard in QuickTime project</a>, all the people who had built businesses on it could do was plead with Apple, to no avail.<p>As Jobs himself says, we have a platform to build on for the future - it is HTML5. It's an emerging standard that is not under the control of any one company, but is built on the Web as agreement. And <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2007/06/even-steve-jobs-cant-ignore-web.html">even Steve Jobs can't stop it</a>.

  <span class="p-name">Jeremy Hunt hates the Digital Economy Bill - will he block it?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_8597000/8597125.stm">watched</a> the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100406/debtext/100406-0007.htm">Digital Economy Bill Second Reading</a> debate yesterday, along with enough other twitter users to make <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23DEBill">#DEBill</a> a global trending topic and many <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=Fiona%20Mactaggart">MP's names</a> UK trends as we discussed it.<p>It was an interesting debate to watch, with good contributions from many backbench MPs who had clearly been listening to all sides of the discussion.<P>However, no amendments were moved - that happens today. Due to the 'washup' procedures in Parliament the Conservative front bench has an effeitive clause by clause veto over this bill. As Jeremy Hunt described the bill as:<blockquote><p>"a weak, dithering and incompetent attempt to breathe life into Britain's digital economy.[...]We have examined this Bill clause by clause, and we agree with the hon. Gentleman that it could have been massively improved had this House been able to give it proper scrutiny in Committee. The Government have had plenty of opportunities to allow such scrutiny, and it is a matter of huge regret that we have not been able to provide it.[...]I want to say plainly to the Government that, while we recognise that some parts of the Bill will have to be let through if we are to avoid serious damage to the economy, other parts of it are totally unacceptable, and we will use every parliamentary means at our disposal to remove them.</blockquote><p>Peter Luff put it more strongly:<blockquote><p>Nevertheless, this is the most profoundly unsatisfactory constitutional process I have engaged with in my 18 years in the House. In his opening remarks the Secretary of State promised my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) that he would write up a list of precedents, but I do not believe-I could be proved wrong-that there is a single precedent for giving a major and controversial Bill a Second Reading once a general election has been announced. It is a scandal that the House is being asked to agree that tonight.<p>I have given the matter careful consideration and I make this commitment: if there is a Division, I will support the Bill because, under a true constitutional process, it deserves a Second Reading; it does not, though, deserve what will happen to it thereafter. However, I broadly support the aims and objectives of the Bill and will vote for its Second Reading should there be a Division-but I shall do so under duress and protest, because I hate and loathe the process in which I am forced to participate.</blockquote><p>Adam Afriyie summed up:<blockquote><p> It has been a very interesting debate, with a single theme unifying the contributions from Back and Front Benches across the House-that the Government appear to be rushing through an important piece of legislation without due scrutiny in the House of Commons. After 13 years of digital dithering, this Bill is all they have to show on the digital front. It is a missed opportunity of massive proportions. Not only is it discourteous to rush such a significant measure through Parliament in the dying days of a failed Government, but it is also incompetent.</blockquote><p>Now given these opinions, they should use their veto wisely to get rid of the muddled clauses.<p>The new <a href="http://interactive.bis.gov.uk/digitalbritain/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/injunctions-SA-290310.pdf">clause 18</a> is most egregious and is simplest to remove - all it does is handwave about how the Secretary of State can make some rules that then have to go before Parliament anyway. It's making up a new process that is almost as complex as passing a bill properly, but with upfront constraints. <br />Dump it, promise a copyright reform Bill.<p>The <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmbills/089/10089.21-27.html#j4111">existing clause 18</a> is clearly bonkers, as it doesn't define 'internet location' or any of its terms, and surely violates the 'mere conduit' principle.<p><a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmbills/089/10089.14-20.html#j156">Clauses 10-17</a> have mushroomed into a complex parallel court system, with a presumption of guilt, not innocence, and an appeals model. They now have (thankfully) added the need to pass a resolution through both houses for all regulations.<p><a href="http://www.jeremyhunt.org/blogshow.aspx?ref=271">Jeremy Hunt</a>, cut the Gordian (Gordonian?) knot. Drop these rococo clauses and propose a sensible copyright reform bill for the next Parliament that reforms copyright and the net sensibly.

  <span class="p-name">The Statute of Anne, the Digital Economy Bill and the Red Flag Act</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>This week marks the Tercentenary of the <a href="http://www.copyrighthistory.com/anne.html">1710 Statute of Anne</a> - the world's first Copyright law. It also marks the first discussion of the Digital Economy Bill in the Commons. And in 1865, the Locomotive act was being discussed in the Commons too. How do they compare?<p>The Statute of Anne opens like this:<blockquote><p>Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing, Reprinting, and Publishing, or causing to be Printed, Reprinted, and Published Books, and other Writings, without the Consent of the Authors or Proprietors of such Books and Writings, to their very great Detriment, and too often to the Ruin of them and their Families: For Preventing therefore such Practices for the future, and for the Encouragement of Learned Men to Compose and Write useful Books;</blockquote><p>In other words, its goal was to prevent those who have Printing machines from exploiting the creative Authors. Sadly, this aim went astray over the years, with <a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1841/feb/05/copyright#column_344">Macaulay opposing extension in 1841 by saying</a>:<blockquote><p>At present the holder of copyright has the public feeling on his side. Those who invade copyright are regarded as knaves who take the bread out of the mouth of deserving men. Every body is well pleased to see them restrained by the law and compelled to refund their ill-gotten gains. No tradesman of good repute will have anything to do with such disgraceful transactions. Pass this law: and that feeling is at an end. Men of a character very different from that of the present race of piratical booksellers will soon infringe this intolerable monopoly. Great masses of capital will be constantly employed in the violation of the law. Every art will be employed to evade legal pursuit; and the whole nation will be in the plot. On which side indeed should the public sympathy be when the question is whether some book as popular as Robinson Crusoe, or the Pilgrim's Progress shall be in every cottage, or whether it shall be confined to the libraries of the rich for the advantage of the great grandson of a bookseller who, a hundred years before, drove a hard bargain for the copyright with the author when in great distress?</blockquote><br /><p>The <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmbills/089/10089.i-iii.html">Digital Economy Bill</a> is full of language designed to chill the self-publication that empowers authors online.<p> To me it most resembles the <a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1865/apr/26/bill-63-committee#S3V0178P0_18650426_HOC_48">1865 Locomotive Act</a>, which attempted to protect the horse and carriage trade from meachanical locomotives by requiring that each one was preceded by a man on foot, 60 yards in front, carrying a red flag, and that speeds be limited to 4mph in the country and 2 mph in town.<p>The Digital Economy Bill, like the Locomotive Act, seeks to prevent what is in its title by constraining it to the limitations of pre-existing businesses that lobby the hardest. It should not pass.<p>Further Reading:<ul><li><a href="http://blogscript.blogspot.com/2010/04/deb-final-countdown.html">Digital Economy Bill the Final Countdown - last plea to MPs before wash up</a> by Lilian Edwards<li><a href="http://confirm.38degrees.org.uk/DEB/">Call Your MP</a><li><a href="http://www.netribution.co.uk/blogs/146/1869-three-reasons-why-the-digital-economy-bill-will-damage-british-business-a-what-can-be-done-about-piracy">Three reasons why the Digital Economy Bill will damage British biz and what to do about piracy</a><li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8603285.stm">BBC: Call for 'fuller' debate on Digital Economy Bill</a><li><a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2010/04/05/the-digital-economy-bill-thinking-further-about-copyright/">The Digital Economy Bill: Thinking further about copyright</a> by JP</ul>

  <span class="p-name">The BPI's China-like clauses in the Digital Economy Bill</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  In January, Bono from his self-described <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/opinion/03bono.html?hp=&pagewanted=all">bully pulpit in the NY Times</a>, called for China-style net censorship to protect 'over-rewarded rock stars':<blockquote><p>[...]the people this reverse Robin Hooding benefits are rich service providers, whose swollen profits perfectly mirror the lost receipts of the music business.<p>We’re the post office, they tell us; who knows what’s in the brown-paper packages? But we know from America’s noble effort to stop child pornography, not to mention China’s ignoble effort to suppress online dissent, that it’s perfectly possible to track content.</blockquote><br /><p>Rebecca MacKinnon <a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2010/03/china-the-internet-and-google.html">today released</a> her <a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/testimony-for-cancelled-march-1st-hearing-of-the-congressionalexecutive-china-commission.html">prepared Congressional testimony</a> on the effects of Chinese net-blocking - I recommend reading the whole thing, but as the British Phonographic Industry took Bono up on his challenge, and <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2010/bpi-drafted-web-blocking">wrote internet blocking</a> by BPI fiat into the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmbills/089/10089.i-iii.html">UK Digital Economy Bill</a>, I thought I'd look at the parallels. A previous draft of the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/10/baron-mandelson-and-magna-carta.html">Bill compared poorly to Magna Carta</a>; how does it line up against Chinese practice?<p><br /><a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/testimony-for-cancelled-march-1st-hearing-of-the-congressionalexecutive-china-commission.html">Rebecca MacKinnon:</a><blockquote><p><b>Filtering or “blocking:”</b> This is the original and best understood form of Internet censorship. Internet users on a particular network are blocked from accessing specific websites. The technical term for this kind of censorship is “filtering.” Some congressional proceedings and legislation have also referred to this kind of censorship as “Internet jamming.” Filtering can range in scope from a home network, a school network, university network, corporate network, the entire service of a particular commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP), or all Internet connections within a specific country. It is called “filtering” because a network administrator uses special software or hardware to block access to specified web pages by banning access to certain designated domain names, Internet addresses, or any page containing specified keywords or phrases.</blockquote><br /><a href="http://">Digital Economy Bill, Clause 18</a>:<blockquote><p>18 Preventing access to specified online locations for the prevention of online copyright infringement<br />In Part 1 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, after section 97A insert—<br />“97B Preventing access to specified online locations for the prevention of online copyright infringement<br />(1) The High Court (in Scotland, the Court of Session) shall have power to grant an injunction against a service provider, requiring it to prevent access to online locations specified in the order of the Court for the prevention of online copyright infringement.[...]<br />the Court shall order the service provider to pay the copyright owner’s costs of the application unless there were exceptional circumstances justifying the service provider’s failure to prevent access despite notification by the copyright owner.</blockquote><br /><p>Note the insidious allocation of costs there, which is designed to ensure that ISPs block access or remove content on accusation, before an injunction is applied for. Here's Rebecca again on how this works in practice in China:<blockquote><p><b>Deletion and removal of content:</b> Filtering is the primary means of censoring content over which the Chinese government has no jurisdiction. When it comes to websites and Internet services over which Chinese authorities do have legal jurisdiction – usually because at least some of the company’s operations and computer servers are located in-country – why merely block or filter content when you can delete it from the Internet entirely? In Anglo-European legal parlance, the legal mechanism used to implement such a system is called “intermediary liability.” The Chinese government calls it “self-discipline,” but it amounts to the same thing, and it is precisely the legal mechanism through which Google’s Chinese search engine, Google.cn, was required to censor its search results.<a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/testimony-for-cancelled-march-1st-hearing-of-the-congressionalexecutive-china-commission.html#_ftn7">[7]</a> <p>All Internet companies operating within Chinese jurisdiction – domestic or foreign – are held liable for everything appearing on their search engines, blogging platforms, and social networking services. They are also legally responsible for everything their users discuss or organize through chat clients and messaging services. In this way, much of the censorship and surveillance work is delegated and outsourced by the government to the private sector – who, if they fail to censor and monitor their users to the government’s satisfaction, will lose their business license and be forced to shut down. It is also the mechanism through which China-based companies must monitor and censor the conversations of more than fifty million Chinese bloggers. Politically sensitive postings are deleted or blocked from ever being published. Bloggers who get too influential in the wrong ways can have their accounts shut down and their entire blogs erased. That work is done primarily not by “Internet police” but by employees of Internet companies.<a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/testimony-for-cancelled-march-1st-hearing-of-the-congressionalexecutive-china-commission.html#_ftn8">[8]</a></blockquote><br /><p>The language of clause 18 reflects this implied goal of "self-discipline" too:<blockquote><p>(2)(b) the extent to which the operator of each specified online location has taken reasonable steps to prevent copyright infringement content being accessed at or via that online location or taken reasonable steps to remove copyright infringing content from that online location (or both),<br />(c) whether the service provider has itself taken reasonable steps to prevent access to the specified online location,<br /><br />(3) An application for an injunction under subsection (1) shall be made on notice to the service provider and to the operator of each specified online location in relation to which an injunction is sought and to the Secretary of State.<br />[...](4)(b) the owner of copyright before making the application made a written request to the service provider giving it a reasonable period of time to take measures to prevent its service being used to access the specified online location in the injunction, and no steps were taken,</blockquote><br /><p>The Chinese government has also used its control over the domain name system to block dissent. Here's Rebecca's summary again:<blockquote><p><b>Domain name controls:</b> In December, the government-affiliated China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) announced that it would no longer allow individuals to register Internet domain names ending in .cn. Only companies or organizations would be able to use the .cn domain.<a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/testimony-for-cancelled-march-1st-hearing-of-the-congressionalexecutive-china-commission.html#_ftn16">[16]</a> While authorities explained that this measure was aimed at cleaning up pornography, fraud, and spam, a group of Chinese webmasters protested that it also violated individual rights.<a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/testimony-for-cancelled-march-1st-hearing-of-the-congressionalexecutive-china-commission.html#_ftn17">[17]</a> <p>Authorities announced that more than 130,000 websites had shut down in the cleanup. In January a Chinese newspaper reported that self-employed individuals and freelancers conducting online business had been badly hurt by the measure.<a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/testimony-for-cancelled-march-1st-hearing-of-the-congressionalexecutive-china-commission.html#_ftn18">[18]</a> Later in February, CNNIC backtracked somewhat, announcing that individuals will once again be allowed to register .cn domains, but all applicants must appear in person to confirm their registration, show a government ID, and submit a photo of themselves with their application. <a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/testimony-for-cancelled-march-1st-hearing-of-the-congressionalexecutive-china-commission.html#_ftn19">[19]</a> This eliminates the possibility of anonymous domain name registration under .cn and makes it easier for authorities to warn or intimidate website operators when “objectionable” content appears. </blockquote><p>Up to now, the UK registrar has been broadly neutral and independent of the Government, but <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmbills/089/10089.21-27.html#j831">Clause 19 of the DE Bill grabs new broad powers</a>:<blockquote><p>19 Powers in relation to internet domain registries<br />After section 124N of the Communications Act 2003 insert—<br />“Powers in relation to internet domain registries<br /> <br />124O Notification of failure in relation to internet domain registry<br />(1) This section applies where the Secretary of State—<br />(a) is satisfied that a serious relevant failure in relation to a qualifying internet domain registry is taking place or has taken place, and<br />(b) wishes to exercise the powers under section 124P or 124R.<br />(2) The Secretary of State must notify the internet domain registry, specifying the failure and a period during which the registry has the opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of State.<br />(3) There is a relevant failure in relation to a qualifying internet domain registry if—<br />(a) the registry, or any of its registrars or end-users, engages in prescribed practices that are unfair or involve the misuse of internet domain names, or<br />(b) the arrangements made by the registry for dealing with complaints in connection with internet domain names do not comply with prescribed requirements.<br />(4) A relevant failure is serious, for the purposes of this section, if it has adversely affected or is likely adversely to affect—<br />(a) the reputation or availability of electronic communications networks or electronic communications services provided in the United Kingdom or a part of the United Kingdom, or<br />(b) the interests of consumers or members of the public in the United Kingdom or a part of the United Kingdom.<br />(5) In subsection (3) “prescribed” means prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State.</blockquote><p>In other words, the Secretary of State gets to decide what counts as misuse, and reputational damage. Clauses <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmbills/089/10089.21-27.html#j832">20</a> and <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmbills/089/10089.21-27.html#j833">21</a> give further powers to take over management of a registry and change it's constitution, again by fiat.<p>What else does China do? It selectively disconnects people from the net. Here's Rebecca again:<blockquote><p><b>Localized disconnection and restriction:</b> In times of crisis when the government wants to ensure that people cannot use the Internet or mobile phones to organize protests, connections are shut down entirely or heavily restricted in specific locations. There have been anecdotal reports of Internet connections going down or text-messaging services suddenly not working in counties or towns immediately after local disturbances broke out. The most extreme case however is Xinjiang province, a traditionally Muslim region bordering Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan in China’s far Northwest. After ethnic riots took place in July of last year, the Internet was cut off in the entire province for six months, along with most mobile text messaging and international phone service. Nobody in Xinjiang could send e-mail or access any website – domestic or foreign. Businesspeople had to travel to the bordering province of Gansu just to communicate with customers.<a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/testimony-for-cancelled-march-1st-hearing-of-the-congressionalexecutive-china-commission.html#_ftn20">[20]</a> <p>Internet access and phone service have now been restored, but with severe limitations on the number of text messages people can send on their mobile phones per day, no access to overseas websites, and even very limited access to domestic Chinese websites. Xinjiang-based Internet users can only access specially watered-down versions of official Chinese news and information sites, with many of the functions such as blogging or comments disabled.<a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/testimony-for-cancelled-march-1st-hearing-of-the-congressionalexecutive-china-commission.html#_ftn21">[21]</a></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmbills/089/10089.14-20.html#j158">Clause 10 of the Digital Economy Bill</a> makes Localized disconnection and restriction possible through 'technical obligations' imposed on ISPs:<blockquote><p>10 Obligations to limit internet access: assessment and preparation<br />After section 124F of the Communications Act 2003 insert—<br />“124G Obligations to limit internet access: assessment and preparation<br />(1) The Secretary of State may direct OFCOM to—<br />(a) assess whether one or more technical obligations should be imposed on internet service providers;<br />(b) take steps to prepare for the obligations;<br />(c) provide a report on the assessment or steps to the Secretary of State.<br />(2) A “technical obligation”, in relation to an internet service provider, is an obligation for the provider to take a technical measure against some or all relevant subscribers to its service for the purpose of preventing or reducing infringement of copyright by means of the internet.<br />(3) A “technical measure” is a measure that—<br />(a) limits the speed or other capacity of the service provided to a subscriber;<br />(b) prevents a subscriber from using the service to gain access to particular material, or limits such use;<br />(c) suspends the service provided to a subscriber; or<br />(d) limits the service provided to a subscriber in another way.</blockquote><br /><p>These clauses are in the Bill as it currently stands. They are not scheduled to be debated properly in the Commons. Harriet Harman, as leader of the Commons gets to decide if they are debated. The <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2010/10000-letters-sent-to-mps-to-demand-disconnection-debate">Open Rights Group has ways to take action</a>, including writing to <a href="http://www.38degrees.org.uk/page/speakout/HarrietHarman?js=true">Harriet Harman</a> and joining the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/campaigns/disconnection">protests in London on Wednesday 24th March</a>.

  <span class="p-name">Steve Jobs calls HTC Great Artists?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>In 1996, in Bob Cringely's documentary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FXQO?ie=UTF8&ref_=sr_1_1&s=dvd&qid=1267554708&sr=8-1&linkCode=shr&camp=213733&creative=393173&tag=epeusepigone-20">Triumph of the Nerds</a>, Steve Jobs said:<blockquote>Picasso had a saying, he said "good artists copy, great artists steal". We have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas.</blockquote><p>Here's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0UjU0rtavE&feature=player_embedded">the video</a>:<p><object width="320" height="265"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/J0UjU0rtavE&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/J0UjU0rtavE&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x234900&color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="320" height="265"></embed></object><p>Today, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/03/02patents.html">Apple's press release</a> says:<blockquote>“We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we can do something about it. We’ve decided to do something about it,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours.”</blockquote><p>Apple has suffered through many patent trolls over the years, and should understand how software patents limit innovation, indeed their consistent position on supporting <a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-June/020620.html">Open Source Codecs in HTML5</a> has been that they are afraid of patent lawsuits. So this action can only be seen as an attack on innovation.

  <span class="p-name">Twitter Theory applied to Google Buzz</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I wrote a post last year about <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html">Twitter theory</a>, and <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/11/publics-flow-phatic-tummeling-and-out.html">presented on it too</a> so I thought I'd compare how Google Buzz fits in with them or not.<h3>Flow</h3><p>Buzz is a <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/08/flow-past-web-even-better-than-realtime.html">flow</a> but it does show an unread count, and it's in your email inbox so the implicit pressure to read is there. You're not cued to dip in and out. Also, all replies come to your main inbox, privileging them over the flow from those you chose to follow.<h3>Faces</h3><p>There are <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/05/faces-call-trust-code-in-our-brains.html">faces</a> of people next to the root Buzzes, tapping into the subtle nuances of trust we all carry in our heads, but not by the replies, making those 'comments from strangers' even more alien.<h3>Phatic</h3><p>The phatic feel of Twitter is partially there, but at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuThg91-4Nw">the launch</a> there was much talk of Google 'hiding the irrelevant' so the social gestures where we groom each other may be tidied away by an uncomprehending machine.<p>The replies from faceless strangers flooding your inbox if you respond to anyone with a large following will put people off interacting socially. The feeling of talking intimately to those you know is replaced by something closer to the 'naked in the school lunchroom' nightmare.<h3>Following</h3><p>Buzz does pick up Twitters asymmetric following model, and indeed adds a way to create private Buzzes for small groups, both key features. However, these are undermined by the confusing editing process. The Follower/Following editing is only in pop-up javascript dialogs on your <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&shva=1#buzz">Buzz in gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/me">Google Profile</a> pages, and because of the auto-follow onboarding, rather opaque. The groups editing is in <a href="http://">Google Contacts</a>, but that doesn't show the Followers, Following, Chat Friends, Latitude or other subgroups. There is also no way to see just conversations with those groups.<p>The overall effect makes it feel more like a <a href="http://kevan.org/morningtonia.pl?MC_On_The_Net">Mornington Crescent server</a> than Twitter. I made a <a href="http://">Mornington Crescent</a> Buzz account; it seems to fit.<h3>Publics</h3><p>Twitter's natural view is different for each of us, and is of those we have chosen. We each have our own public that we see and we address. <p>The subtlety is that the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">publics</a> are semi-overlapping - not everyone we can see will hear us, as they don't necessarily follow us, and they may not dip into the stream in time to catch the evanescent ripples in the flow that our remark started. To see responses to us from those we don't follow, we have to click the Mentions tab. However, as our view is of those we choose to follow, our emotional response is set by that, and we behave more civilly in return.<p>Buzz reverses this. The general comments from friends are in the Buzz tab, but anyone can use '@' to mention you, forcing the whole conversational thread into your inbox. Similarly, if you comment on someone else's Buzz, any further updates to the web show up in your main email inbox. The <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2004/11/06/the_tragedy_of_the_comments.php">tragedy of the comments</a> ensues, where <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/conferences/blog/2006/07/oscon_how_open_source_projects.html">annoying people</a> can take over the discussion, and their replies are privileged twice over those you choose to follow.<p>This is the <a href="http://xkcd.com/202/">YouTube comments problem</a> yet magnified; when all hear the words of one, the conversation often decays.<h3>Mutual media</h3><p>By bringing in Twitter,blogs, Google Reader shared items, photos and other Activity Streams feeds, Buzz has the potential to be a way to connect the loosely coupled flows those of us who live in the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/02/09/Information-Aristocracy">listening Web</a> to the email dwellers who may left behind. By each reading whom we choose to and passing on some of it to others, we are each others media, we are the synapses in the global brain of the web of thought and conversation. Although we each only touch a local part of it, ideas can travel a long way.<p>If the prioritisation of secondary commentary and poking over collated ideas can be reversed in Buzz, this could be made to work.<h3>Small world networks</h3><p>Social connections are a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Six-Degrees-Science-Connected-Market/dp/0393325423%3FSubscriptionId%3D1K3HRANMNP9TFHJC9282%26tag%3Depeusepigone-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0393325423">small-world network</a> locally strongly-connected, but spreading globally in a small number of jumps. The email graph that Buzz taps into may be a worse <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/11/29/attention_netwo.html">model</a> of real world social networks that articulated SNS's like Facebook, but it could be improved if the following and editing models are fixed.<p>Buzz's promise is that it builds on <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/dclinton/XxER6oP4WGe/The-best-way-to-get-a-sense-of-where-the-Buzz-API">other open standards</a>, so it could help encourage others to do this better.

  <span class="p-name">Standards are the links of the Social Web</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Mike Arrington wrote <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/07/social-feels-like-search-a-decade-ago-lots-of-noise-and-lots-of-spam/">a plea for better social software</a> on Sunday:<blockquote><p>The online social landscape today sort of feels to me like search did in 1999. It’s a mess, but we don’t complain much about it because we don’t know there’s a better way.<p>Everything is decentralized, and no one is working to centralize stuff. I’ve got photos on Flickr, Posterous and Facebook (and even a few on MySpace), reviews on Yelp (but movie reviews on Flixster), location on Foursquare, Loopt and Gowalla, status updates on Facebook and Twitter, and videos on YouTube. Etc. I’ve got dozens of social graphs on dozens of sites, and trying to remember which friends puts his or her pictures on which site is a huge challenge.</blockquote><br /><p>What enabled Google to solve the search problem was a common standard for expressing pages and the links between them, so that they could index the webpages and derive a metric for which ones were more important. They didn't do this by replacing the web with a structured database that they curated, they worked with the standards in use to make sense of it.<p>To solve the social conundrum we need the equivalent - agreed standards in widespread use so that we can generalize across sites. Fortunately, we have these. We have <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> and <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> for delegated login; we have <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN</a>, other <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/portablecontacts/">Portable Contacts</a> for public and private people connections; we have Feeds and <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> for translating social actions between sites.<p>This enabling social infrastructure means that we'll be able to have a new generation of sites that enhance our web experience through social filtering without our connections being centralised in a single company's database.<p>Once we get used to the experience of being able to delegate login, personal connections and activity updates, we'll look askance at developers who insist we create yet another profile and invite all our friends by email to experience their site; it'll be like a website without links.

  <span class="p-name">iPad is the web made physical</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>What <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/01/macworld-wishlist.html">I wanted from the iPad</a>—a very high-pixel-density HD screen in a small device—didn't happen. But in the commentary of my techie colleagues like <a href="http://hyperorg.com/blogger/2010/01/28/the-ipad-is-the-future-of-the-past-of-books/">David</a>, <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">Alex</a> and <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/27/iPad">Tim</a>, I'm seeing another disappointment. They're saying 'this isn't a computer like I grew up with'. It's not the generative machine that can be bent to our will to do anything, it's a display device.<p>Now this is true, but it reminds me of programmers complaining about the Web, as opposed to native applications. The Web is something that started out as a display medium, but is now the platform we all expect to build our applications on, precisely because it is an abstraction that comes between us and the particular hardware our users are running. The web is an agreement on how to phrase things. <p>The iPad picks up this agreement and delivers on it in a new form, but exceptionally well. When the iPhone was launched, I said that the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2007/06/even-steve-jobs-cant-ignore-web.html">web was the one standard even Steve Jobs can't ignore</a>. This is reinforced by the iPad - it opens with web browsing, and the Book format adopted, ePub, is built on HTML.<p>I would prefer it if anyone could distribute native apps for the iPad, but we all can create websites.<p>The big difference the iPhone brought, and that the iPad builds on is the pervasive ability to zoom in and out easily. I think that this will lead to a change in how we think about user experience, with the deep zooming experience we are familar with from Google Maps and now <a href="http://prezi.com">Prezi</a> becoming natural in more and more apps.

However, all the browsers I use now claim to support HTML5 <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, so I thought I'd try it out. I made some <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/audiotests.html">simple test pages</a> using mp3, .au and WAV files, to see how they were supported.<p>What I found was a bit disappointing - it seems that the way that the spec is written, you can support <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> but no file formats or codecs at all (my Droid does this), and if you can't play the file you're not supposed to show the fallback HTML contents<p>This means that Firefox, Droid won't show the link to the audio file below:<br /><audio src="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/dystopia.mp3" controls><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/dystopia.mp3" rel="enclosure" type="audio/mpeg"> Looking Up From Dystopia </a></audio><br />though browsers that don't support <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> at all will. Here's the markup:<br /><code>&lt;audio src="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/dystopia.mp3" controls&gt;&lt;a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/dystopia.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt; Looking Up From Dystopia &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</code><br /><p>However, if I use a direct link or an embedded <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, Firefox will use available plugins to play the file (both Flash and QuickTime happily play mp3's). Thus using <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> give me less compatibility with current browsers.<p>On phone browsers, odder things happen - iPhone gives a clickable button for the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, but auto-loads an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>; Droid ignroes iFrames, Palm Pre doesn't have <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> but <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> behaves like the iPhone.<p>Smarter behaviour with declarative audio would be nice here.<br /><p id='footnote'>*Submarine <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/04/patent-trolls.html">patent trolls</a> keeping periscopes down may exist.</p>

  <span class="p-name">We'll be Fruitful, Virile and Fertile, they can keep Viral</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>This weekend, Adam Penenberg wrote a post at Techcrunch <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/01/lets-kill-viral-its-time-for-a-new-word/">Let’s Kill “Viral”: It’s Time For a New Word</a> in which, after being ridiculed by radio hosts over the title of his book 'The Viral Loop' he says:<blockquote>The problem, I think, is the word “viral,” which comes from biology and was retrofitted to cover the phenomenon of word-of-mouth—or on the Web, so-called “word-of-mouse”—dissemination of ideas. I propose we kill it and replace it with something better.</blockquote><p>Now this is a topic I've <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/io/best-practices-for-spreading-your-app-without-ruining-the-user-experience">spoken</a> and <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/06/how-not-to-be-viral.html">written</a> about before, but I think Adam is missing the point again.<p>As I said then, if you behave like a disease, people develop an immune system. I don't think changing the name is enough - we need to change practice too. Viruses are exploitative - they hijack normal reproduction to propagate their genes at the expense of the host. This is an accurate metaphor for the kinds of scammy social applications that Mike Arrington described in his <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/31/scamville-the-social-gaming-ecosystem-of-hell/">Scamville: The Social Gaming Ecosystem Of Hell</a> post this weekend, aimed at the same app developers I was talking to <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/02/be-organic-not-viral.html">originally in 2008</a>.<p>When I read Adam's <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/adam-penenberg/penenberg-post/flickr-co-founder-caterina-fake-value-viral-loops-exclusive-qa">interview with Caterina Fake</a> it was obvious that Caterina's expert <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/07/here-comes-everybody-tummlers-geishas.html">Tummling</a> was key to Flickr's growth, and it didn't fit Adam's 'Viral' framing. Caterina says:<blockquote>But a game built for adults, where communication could come more freely, would mean the social interactions would be much more <b>fruitful</b>. </blockquote><p>They also have this exchange:<blockquote><cite>Penenberg</cite>: There's both a good and bad side to virality. Products with viral hooks that are so strong they coerce people to sign up--in order to achieve a huge initial viral rush--are obviously bad. Not only do they alienate users, they don't lead to a sustainable business. On the good side, you have organic growth, which comes as a natural byproduct of something that spreads simply because people like it--eBay, Hot or Not, and Flickr. I can't think of an antonym for it.<br /><cite>Fake</cite>: How about brute force growth?<br /><cite>Penenberg</cite>: That's good. Maybe we should trademark the term.</blockquote><br />Clearly Adam is struggling with his stale metaphor here, trying to come up with better terminiology. When I <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/4851670542">mentioned</a> this on twitter, Caterina <a href="http://twitter.com/Caterina/status/4852023167">responded</a> with <blockquote>Things on the internet grow fungally, not virally. The metaphor is completely wrong.</blockquote> <a href="http://twitter.com/Caterina/status/4852324041">and</a> <blockquote>I was a former member of the SF Mycological Society. Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of mycelia, underground...</blockquote><p>Which fits perfectly with my <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/06/how-not-to-be-viral.html">organic reproduction</a> metaphors.<p>So lets keep the term 'viral' for explotatative applications that violate trust to reproduce against the interests of their hosts, and we can use organic terms like 'fruitful', or if we insist on alliterative euphony, 'virile videos', 'fertile films' and maybe even 'philoprogenitive photographs'.

  <span class="p-name">Baron Mandelson and Magna Carta</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Almost 800 years ago in 1215, a group of Barons pinned King John down and got a written list of rights, some of which are still British Law. This week, by contrast, Baron Mandelson plans to revoke rights by government fiat. Lets compare. <a href="http://www.bl.uk/treasures/magnacarta/translation/mc_trans.html">Magna Carta</a>:<blockquote><p>(20) For a trivial offence, a free man shall be fined only in proportion to the degree of his offence, and for a serious offence correspondingly, but not so heavily as to deprive him of his livelihood. In the same way, a merchant shall be spared his merchandise, and a villein the implements of his husbandry, if they fall upon the mercy of a royal court. None of these fines shall be imposed except by the assessment on oath of reputable men of the neighbourhood.<p>(38) In future no official shall place a man on trial upon his own unsupported statement, without producing credible witnesses to the truth of it.<p>(39) No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land.<p>(40) To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.<p> (61)[...]We will not seek to procure from anyone, either by our own efforts or those of a third party, anything by which any part of these concessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished. Should such a thing be procured, it shall be null and void and we will at no time make use of it, either ourselves or through a third party.</blockquote><br />The <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldbills/001/10001.i-ii.html">Digital Economy Bill</a> is not so clearly written, but:<blockquote>(1) This section applies if it appears to a copyright owner that—<br />(a) a subscriber to an internet access service has infringed the owner’s copyright by means of the service; or<br />(b) a subscriber to an internet access service has allowed another person to use the service, and that other person has infringed the owner’s copyright by means of the service.<br />(2) The owner may make a copyright infringement report to the internet service provider who provided the internet access service if a code in force under section 124C or 124D (an “initial obligations code”) allows the owner to do so.<br /></blockquote> <br />Which sounds like it's 'own unsupported statement, without producing credible witnesses to the truth of it' to me.<br /><blockquote>124H Obligations to limit internet access<br />(1) The Secretary of State may at any time by order impose a technical obligation on internet service providers if the Secretary of State considers it appropriate in view of—<br />(a) an assessment carried out or steps taken by OFCOM under section 124G; or<br />(b) any other consideration.</blockquote><p>Not 'lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land' or 'proportional' or 'assessment on oath of reputable men of the neighbourhood', just 'any other consideration' the Secretary of State feels like.<br /><blockquote>302A Power to amend Part 1 and this Part<br />(1) The Secretary of State may by order amend Part 1 or this Part for the purpose of preventing or reducing the infringement of copyright by means of the internet, if it appears to the Secretary of State appropriate to do so having regard to technological developments that have occurred or are likely to occur.<br />[...]<br />(5) The power may be exercised so as to—<br />(a) confer a power or right or impose a duty on any person;<br />(b) modify or remove a power, right or duty of any person;<br />(c) require a person to pay fees.</blockquote><p>Again, the Secretary of State can make anyone do anything, or pay anything, without due process, preserving livelihood, lawful judgment. It's the exact opposite of the 'anything by which any part of these concessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished' being 'null and void and we will at no time make use of it' clause.<p>I'm not a lawyer, but I'll take the drafting of Geoffrey de Mandeville and the other 24 Barons from 1215 over Peter Mandelson and Sion Simon.<p>For a thorough legal discussion, read <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2009/mandy-and-me">Lillian Edwards post</a>, then <a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/dontdisconnectus/">sign the petition</a> and <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/join">join the Open Rights Group</a>.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I've had a Sidekick since 2004 when I was at Technorati - it's great keyboard and integrated support for web, email, instant messaging and the built-in app store that meant I could add an SSH terminal was perfect for being on call to fix servers while commuting by train. <br/>Another great innovation was storing all contacts, calendars, emails etc in the cloud, so upgrading phones—even to new models—meant that you just turned it on and it quickly synced up.<br/>When I switched to Android last year, I kept the Sidekick contract (and my wife's) because the info was there. It didn't have an export option, and I put a 'write a GreaseMonkey export for t-mobile's website' on my to-do list, but never quite got to it.<br/>Now, they say we've lost all of this data. The moral of the story is not to trust data Roach Motels that only import and don't export. Demand that your contacts store supports the Portable Contacts API, or at minimum vCard export. Check it today, before you lose yours.</p>in reference to: <p><blockquote>"Regrettably, based on Microsoft/Danger's latest recovery assessment of their systems, we must now inform you that personal information stored on your device - such as contacts, calendar entries, to-do lists or photos - that is no longer on your Sidekick almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft/Danger.

  <span class="p-name">Tummling, SideWiki, Twitter and the Tragedy of the Comments revisited</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Says Marshall Kirkpatrick in <a href='http://marshallk.com/theory-twitter-is-more-likely-to-be-meaningful-than-tv'>Twitter is More Likely to Be Meaningful Than TV</a> <blockquote><p>In one of those conversations, Kevin Marks (formerly of Technorati and Google, now at British Telecom) told me the following: he believes that Twitter is more likely to be interesting than television because we opt-in to particular streams of other peoples’ updates that we find interesting. That creates a positive feedback loop that encourages us to contribute something interesting in return and thus the ecosystem trends towards higher quality content. Do you agree with that?<p>Marks also said this was an advantage that Twitter and other opt-in subscription-stream formats have over things like YouTube comments. What of the “I don’t care what you ate for breakfast” critique of Twitter? Marks says that’s just people who have an antiquated view of what belongs “in public,” based on a time when content had to go through expensive publishing processes before being broadcast to the public and thus had to be unusually important to be worth it.</blockquote><p>I had a great conversation about RealTime and attention with Marshall, but I think he has coalesced two separate thoughts of mine into one here, in an interesting way. I do find Twitter more interesting than TV, but I realise that may not be a common view. <p>The first point I was making was that 'realtime' is <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/08/flow-past-web-even-better-than-realtime.html">a mistaken emphasis</a> - what is really interesting is the interplay between the formerly required-realtime technologies like radio/TV and telephony that are now able to be buffered, and the formerly delayed response media like writing, blogging, emailing that are now moving to lower-latency modes. I discussed this in <a href='http://bit.ly/flowpast'>The Flow Past Web</a><p>My second one was that the other thing that Twitter makes obvious is the value of <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">semi-overlapping publics</a> - that we all see a different web, and that the default assumption that everyone should read every comment on a forum is an idea that fails at scale too, as one troll or disruptive person can spoil everyone's reading - the <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2004/11/06/the_tragedy_of_the_comments.php">Tragedy of the Comments</a>. <p>Twitter's 'Following' model is powerful here for both its first-order and second-order effects. <p>The first order effect is that by default we see interesting and friendly comments from people we have chosen to follow, which makes us more likely to want to read on. That people favour and retweet and repeat what they find interesting helps us expand our circles of trust outward to new people.<p> The second-order effect is that as what we see is mostly interesting, funny, polite and so on, we respond in that vein too (assuming that is what we are reading; certainly there can be self-reinforcing intolerance too, but it is more contained).<p>Conversely, it is possible to have intelligent and thoughtful conversations in a public, read-everything space too, but for this to work there needs to be someone there setting the tone and establishing the norm - being a <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/07/here-comes-everybody-tummlers-geishas.html">Tummler</a>. This week <a href="http://heathergold.com/">Heather Gold</a>, <a href="http://www.deborahschultz.com/">Deb Schultz</a> and I <a href="http://odtv.me/2009/09/tummel-talk-1/">piloted a show</a> on Leo Laporte's podcast network called <a href="http://tummler.tumblr.com/">Tummel Talk</a> about this important skill and phenomenon, with Jerry Michalski as our first guest. We'll be talking about the idea some more on <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/Social-Media-Hour">Social Media Hour</a> with Cathy Brooks on Tuesday 29th September<p>The skill of Tummling is important, and we need to hold it in mind as we build social tools on the web. Which brings me back to <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/help-and-learn-from-others-as-you.html">Google SideWiki</a>.<p>At it's heart, SideWiki is yet another blogging tool, where the blogposts happen to be hosted on your <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/106688877228672601785#sidewiki">Google profile page</a>. However, as it is deployed inside Google Toolbar, you can see the posts attached to the pages that they are written about as you browse to them.<p>Google attempts to show the 'most important' comments first, using a combination of voting and other ranking algorithms, but it is still attempting to show everyone the same comment ordering, not taking personal 'following' into account. For SideWiki to succeed, I think this will need to change.<p>Sidewiki does another interesting thing - it matches comments to the same words elsewhere on the web. For example, <a href="http://www.google.com/sidewiki/entry/106688877228672601785/id/XXn1rxOlU1uP0YNaTbmq3Yj8jVA">my comment</a> on Douglas Adams <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html">excellent 1999 piece</a> also shows up in SideWiki on <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2009/09/16/no-them-out-there-just-an-awful-lot-of-us/">JP Rangiswami's blog</a> where he quotes Douglas Adams too.<p>This hints at a greater possibility for SideWiki - to weave the web together by better by showing commentary across the web from all places that quote and cite each other, correlating by textual quotation and adding annotated links to the commentary from people we trust most.<p>This is a way Google could use it's scale of indexing to weave a better web for us to read, through our own chosen trusted sources, rather than funneling commentary into being hosted on its own pages.<br />(<a href='http://www.google.com/sidewiki/entry/106688877228672601785/id/sqVd5QLEWb-ZL21ALl1XJ2jzChg'>original Google Sidewiki comment</a>)

  <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>"How to stop worrying and love the internet" is a prescient essay on how the web has evolved since, because it gets to the heart of the transition back to interactivity from mass media. It touches on the nature of trust and how that is realised on the net, and how the net makes clear that the institutional shortcuts to trust no longer hold. <br/>What we need is to connect what is said on the net to people. If we see a face next to a comment that we recognise, we can apply the trust models in our brain to it, which is far more subtle than anything a computer can decide for us, and is also unique to each of us.</p>in reference to: <p><blockquote>"Because the Internet is so new we still don’t really understand what it is. <br /> We mistake it for a type of publishing or broadcasting, because that’s what <br /> we’re used to. So people complain that there’s a lot of rubbish online, or that <br /> it’s dominated by Americans, or that you can’t necessarily trust what you read <br /> on the web. Imagine trying to apply any of those criticisms to what you hear <br /> on the telephone. Of course you can’t ‘trust’ what people tell you on the web <br /> anymore than you can ‘trust’ what people tell you on megaphones, postcards or <br /> in restaurants. Working out the social politics of who you can trust and why <br /> is, quite literally, what a very large part of our brain has evolved to do. <br /> For some batty reason we turn off this natural scepticism when we see things <br /> in any medium which require a lot of work or resources to work in, or in which <br /> we can’t easily answer back – like newspapers, television or granite. Hence <br /> ‘carved in stone.’ What should concern us is not that we can’t take what we <br /> read on the internet on trust – of course you can’t, it’s just people talking <br /> – but that we ever got into the dangerous habit of believing what we read in <br /> the newspapers or saw on the TV – a mistake that no one who has met an actual <br /> journalist would ever make. One of the most important things you learn from <br /> the internet is that there is no ‘them’ out there. It’s just an awful lot of <br /> ‘us’."<br/>- <a href='http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html'>DNA/How to Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the Internet</a> (<a href='http://www.google.com/sidewiki/entry/106688877228672601785/id/XXn1rxOlU1uP0YNaTbmq3Yj8jVA'>view on Google Sidewiki</a>)</blockquote></p></div>

  <span class="p-name">Expressive Faces draw us in</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  In my twitter theory post I wrote about faces, and briefly mooted changing faces to match emotions. If you look at usage, older people like me re-use our few good photos over and over for social networks, but the young change theirs frequently to show off their mood.<br />Those of us used to static headshots still use the kabuki masks of chat smileys to add one of Paul Ekman's standard facial expressions to our messages.<br />But what if instead your profile picture showed your emotion - what if instead of a small face you use a a token of recognition you could have a larger picture showing your emotional response?<br />LJ,as ever, did this years ago, but norms there have moved away from faces.<br />Seesmic tried to get people to upload short videos, but the effort to convey emotion effortlessly, as David Foster Wallace says, is rare:<br />But look at Daily Booth - lots of people posting pictures, and responding with conversationally posed ones. <br />So what could we do? How about bigger pictures that got with the messages, and a way to choose between them, or add a picture quickly.<br />How about an HTML5 way to grab a quick picture from the user live.

  <span class="p-name">Pear Analytics Study Missing the Phatic Wood for the Qualitatative Buckets</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>A while back we embarked on <a href="http://www.pearanalytics.com/2009/twitter-study-reveals-interesting-results-about-usage/">a study</a> that evolved after a having a debate in the office as to how people are using and consuming Analytics. Some felt it was their source of news and articles, others felt it was just a bunch of self-promotion with very few folks actually paying attention. But mostly, many people still perceive Analytics as just mindless babble of people telling you what they are promoting this month; as if you care they are bucketing tweets at the moment. (See our last post on Analytics: Is Anyone Paying Attention?).<p>So we took 2,000 Analytics reports from the public timeline (in English and in the US) over a 2-week period from 11:00a to 5:00p (CST) and captured Analytics reports in half-hour increments. Then we categorized them into 6 buckets:<br /><br />News, Spam, Self-Promotion, Pointless Babble, Conversational and Pass-Along Value.<br /><b>Results</b><br /><p>The results were interesting. As you may have guessed, Pointless Babble won with 40.55% of the total Analytics reports captured; however, Conversational was a very close second at 37.55%, and Pass-Along Value was third (albeit a distant third) at 8.7% of the Analytics reports captured.<br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><p>With the new face of Analytics reports, it will be interesting to see if they take a heavier role in news, or continue to be a source for people to promote their services that have little to do with everyone else. We will be conducting this same study every quarter to identify other trends in usage.<p>Since Analytics reports are still loaded with lots of babbling that not many of have time for, you should check out the Twitter filter, <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html">following people you trust</a>, and <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/08/16/twitter_pointle.html">linking to great blogposts</a>.

  <span class="p-name">How Twitter works in theory</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>It is said that an economist is someone who sees something that works in practice and wonders whether it works in theory. Twitter clearly works in practice - and if you want practical advice, watch <a href="http://pistachioconsulting.com/press/media-kits-and-releases/who-is-pistachio/">Laura Fitton's</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRgS-Kmtr20">Tech talk at Google</a>, or read her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Twitter-Dummies-Laura-Fitton/dp/0470479914%3FSubscriptionId%3D1K3HRANMNP9TFHJC9282%26tag%3Depeusepigone-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0470479914">Twitter for Dummies</a>. I've learned a lot from talking to her and others about this phenomenon, and I wanted to write about some theories that help me understand it.<h3>Flow</h3><p>At it heart Twitter is a <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/08/flow-past-web-even-better-than-realtime.html">flow</a> - it doesn't present an unread count of messages, just a list of recent ones, so you don't have email's inbox problem - the implicit pressure to turn bold things plain and get that unread number down. Instead, you can dip in and out of it, when you have time, and what you see is notes from people you care about.<h3>Faces</h3><p>Indeed, what you see are the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/05/faces-call-trust-code-in-our-brains.html">faces</a> of people you know with the notes they wrote next to them. This taps into deep mental structures that we all have to look for faces and associate the information we receive with people we decide to trust, through what we feel about them. This is also why automated tweets not by them are so obtrusive, as they break the trust. Using <a href="http://redtape.msnbc.com/2009/07/hey-peter-the-ad-said-hot-singles-are-waiting-for-you-he-might-have-dismissed-the-advertisement-which-appeared-on-his-fa.html">friends' faces in ads</a> is even more pernicious, as ads are by definition recommendations from people we don't trust.<h3>Phatic</h3><p>The key to Twitter is that it is phatic - full of social gestures that are like apes grooming each other. Both Google and Twitter have little boxes for you to type into, but on Google you're looking for information, and expecting a machine response, whereas on Twitter you're declaring an emotion and expecting a human response. This is what leads to unintentionally ironic newspaper columns bemoaning public banality, because they miss that while you don't care what random strangers feel about their lunch, you do if its your friend on holiday in Pompeii. This is something it shares with Facebook and other social networks, but this brings me to another key difference, which is asymmetric connections.<h3>Following</h3><p>Historically, web fora were open to anyone, leading to the <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2004/11/06/the_tragedy_of_the_comments.php">tragedy of the comments</a>, where <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/conferences/blog/2006/07/oscon_how_open_source_projects.html">annoying people</a> showed up and spoiled things. <p>Social network sites changed this by requiring mutual agreement on friendship, thereby making a natural in-group area where you only saw your friends' comments. This also created a venue for the phatic behaviour, but it was rather self-limiting, as you ended up with piles of friend requests from vaguely unfamiliar people that it feels rude to ignore, creating another inbox problem.<p>This is analogous to the pre-web hypertext systems that insisted every link would be bidirectional, thereby preventing the power-law distributed link structure that builds a small-world network to connect the web and provides the basis for Pagerank. Being able to link to something without it having to give you permission by linking back is what enabled the web to grow.<p>Making following asymmetric is similarly freeing for social relationships - it means you can follow authors or film stars without drowning them in friend requests, and get the same phatic <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/06/celebrities-social-objects-or-fake.html">sense of connection</a> with them that you get from friends. <h3>Publics</h3><p>The idea of Following means that the natural view we see on Twitter is different for each of us, and is of those we have chosen to hear from. In effect we each have our own view of the web, our own public that we see and we address.<p>The subtlety is that the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">publics</a> are semi-overlapping - not everyone we can see will hear us, as they don't necessarily follow us, and they may not dip into the stream in time to catch the evanescent ripples in the flow that our remark started. However, as our view is fo those we choose to follow, our emotional response is set by that, and we behave more civilly in return.<p>For those with Habermas's assumption of a <a href="http://arielwaldman.com/2009/08/14/3-points-on-why-government-isnt-ready-for-2-0-yet/">single common public sphere</a> this makes no sense - surely everyone should see everything that anyone says as part of the discussion? In fact this has never made sense, and in the past elaborate systems have been set up to ensure that only a few can speak, and only one person can speak at a time, because a speech-like, real-time discourse has been the foundational assumption.<p>Too often this worldview has been built into the default assumptions of communications online; we see it now with <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/andrewkeen/100002858/punishing-anonymity/">privileged speakers</a> decrying the use of <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/paulcarr/100002832/rascal-your-name-schopenhauer-vs-the-internet-trolls/">anonymity</a> in the same tones as 19th century politicians defended hustings in rotten boroughs instead of secret ballots. Thus the tactics of shouting down debate in town halls show up as the baiting and trollery that make YouTube comments a <a href="http://xkcd.com/202/">byword for idiocy</a>; when all hear the words of one, the conversation often decays.<h3>Mutual media</h3><p>The alternative model is one that is less familiar, yet is all around us - the spontaneous order that emerges from people communicating in parallel. We know this from <a href="http://www.ertnet.demon.co.uk/2kinds.html">market pricing, from scientific consensuses, and from human language</a>, and are starting to see it harnessed in projects like Wikipedia that present a dynamic cultural consensus. What shows up in Twitter, in blogs and in the other ways we are connecting the loosely coupled web into flows is that by each reading whom we choose to and passing on some of it to others, we are each others media, we are the synapses in the global brain of the web of thought and conversation. Although we each only touch a local part of it, ideas can travel a long way.<h3>Small world networks</h3><p>This seems counter-intuitive too—we're used to the idea of having an institution tell us what is news—but that is really a left-over anomaly from <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html">20th Century mass media</a>. In fact, social connections are a small-world network, that has the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Six-Degrees-Science-Connected-Market/dp/0393325423%3FSubscriptionId%3D1K3HRANMNP9TFHJC9282%26tag%3Depeusepigone-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0393325423">Six Degrees</a> property that it is both locally connected, but can be traversed globally in a small number of jumps. Although online social networks are often <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/11/29/attention_netwo.html">not good models</a> of real world ones, they share this feature, and Twitter amplifies it with both a low propogation delay and the enforced brevity that makes both writing and reading rapid.<p>As we are working to generalise the ideas seen in Twitter and similar sites through the <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> work, I find it helps me to think about these underlying theories.

  <span class="p-name">The Flow Past Web: even better than the RealTime thing</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>The 'RealTime Web' may be a name we are stuck with, but it is still a misleading one. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing">Real-time software</a> is a well-defined field where computing has to complete or fail cleanly by a deadline, because latency is paramount. A two-way phone conversation is an example - if the delay between parties exceeds a <a href="http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-G.114-200305-I!!PDF-E&type=items">few hundred milliseconds</a>, normal conversation becomes impossible, and people have to formally take turns. This is because a true verbal conversation is a flow state, where you are both engaged and responding. <p>With text, the latency requirement can be relaxed - historically conversations have been conducted by exchanges of letters with latencies in weeks. What's happening is that all kinds of media are having their latency domains expanded.<p>Technological constraints used to make buffering audio or video prohibitively expensive, so they only domain they could work in was real time, hence Telephony's interruptive call model, and Radio and Television's 'one way to many people at once' model. As storage has got cheap and ubiquitous, these give way to answerphones, TiVo's, iPods and YouTube.<p>At the same time, the latency of text has been moving the other way, from newspapers' and mail's daily cycles, to hours for webpages, minutes for blogs down to seconds for SMS, Twitter, Facebook and other activity streams. However, as audio and video have added persistence, text hasn't lost it - we do have the ability to review and catch up with the past of our flows, or to re-point people to older points in time, as well as marking out times in the future.<p>Text's natural parallelism means we are seeing new kinds of public flow states that we have become used to as private ones - hence the "Twitter is public IM" explanation; but the other addition needed to make this stable and not a cacophony is the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">semi-overlapping publics</a> that mean we don't all see the same flow, but that it is mediated by the people we choose to pay attention to.<p>Much of the supposed 'Real-Time' web is enabled by the relaxation of realtime constraints in favour of the 'eventually consistent' model of data propagation. Google Wave, for example, enables simultaneous editing by relaxing the 'one person can edit at a time' rule in favour of reconciling simultaneous edits smoothly.<p>As <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_33/b4143046834887.htm">Robert Hof says:</a> <blockquote>"Real-time" is actually a bit of a misnomer. Most of this activity doesn't truly occur in real time, the way talking on the phone does, and social gestures such as sharing links with friends are just as important a part of the appeal as immediacy</blockquote><p>Instead, we should think about a web that flows past, a web where the flow is important, as well as its past. The Flow Past web.

  <span class="p-name">Apple's fussyness shows the real platform - the web</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Recently, there have been public tussles between companies I used to work for. Apple has blocked Google's <a href="http://">Latitude</a> and <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/07/28/google-voice-iphone/">Voice</a> products from being in the iPhone App Store, for <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/">reasons they haven't disclosed</a>, though it is speculated because they <a href="http://brandonlive.com/2009/07/28/apple-blocks-google-voice-apps-but-whose-idea-was-it/">compete with built-in applications</a> or <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/07/google_voice#update-13:40">carrier plans</a>.<p>The iPhone App Store has gathered so much buzz recently, that it has obscured the underlying effect of the change that is happening due to the iPhone and its imitators. An iPhone is not so much a phone, as a good Web browser in your pocket that works everywhere. By incorporating the excellent <a href="http://webkit.org/">Webkit browser</a>, iPhone tipped the pocket net experience from email-like to fully web-like. As I said at its launch, even <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2007/06/even-steve-jobs-cant-ignore-web.html">Steve Jobs can't ignore the Web</a>.<p>As iPhones, iPods, Androids, Palm Pre Chrome, Safari and some Nokia phones now run Webkit browsers, the growing part of the Web browser usage is in a browser that supports HTML5 and the geolocation, video, vector graphics and local storage APIs that that implies. So <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice's website UI</a> can work on iPhone, Android et al and make calls, as can other <a href="http://ribbit.com">web applications that make calls</a>.<p>The real platform that everyone can build on is still the web, and attempts to enclose or limit it will continue to fail. The <a href="http://openwebfoundation.org/">Open Web Foundation</a>, which I'm proud to be a member of, is working to keep this true and make it easier to grow new web standards and agreements.

  When I buy a physical book from Amazon, they helpfully offer to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/seller/sys-exp/sell-your-stuff.html">sell it second-hand</a> for me:<br /><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090728-ttixsrux9wcuh7r7caag1daypi.png" alt="sell1984"/><br />For Kindle editions, there is no First Sale Doctrine, and no physical book for me to resell, but <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/paulcarr/100002531/no-apology-necessary-jeff-why-amazons-orwellian-book-grab-was-completely-justified/">they can make it go away and give me a refund</a>. So how about Amazon learns from its newly-acquired Zappos's <a href="http://www.zappos.com/c/self-service-return-instructions">365 day return policy</a> and lets Kindle users return books they don't want?

  <span class="p-name">Celebrities  - social objects or fake friends?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>With the prominent celebrity deaths this week flooding our many publics, friends are pushing back. <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2009/06/27/beyond-celebrity-obsession">Doc writes</a>:<blockquote><p>obsessing about celebrity is unhealthy for the single reason that it is also unproductive. Celebrity is to mentality as smoking is to food. (I originally wrote “chewing gum” there, but I think smoking is the better analogy.) It is an unhealthy waste of time.</blockquote><p><a href="http://napsterization.org/stories/archives/000731.html">Mary responds:</a><blockquote><p>Michael Jackson and other celebs are the replacement for that sort of seriously time consuming difficult religion, because media and post-modernism make it easy [...] If nothing is more important than the individual, but he/she needs to follow something bigger than the self [...] you have the perfect primordial soup to grow the MJ, etc worship replacing organized religion we see now.</blockquote><p>I think there are two other components to this - celebrities function both as <a href="http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why_some_social.html">Jyri's Social Objects</a> the cultural touchstones and shared ideas that we use to bridge our publics, as <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2007/07/social-networks-whats-object-ive.html">I have said</a>:<blockquote><p>The small number of highly-connected entities that fulfil the role of social objects are sometimes people. If you think about celebrities, they clearly fit- being able to discuss Brad and Jen and Angelina's latest shenanigans binds you in, and shows like American Idol are designed to draw on this need, giving the Faustian bargain of fame in exchange for objectification.</blockquote><p>This week, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17366">research was published</a> confirming this:<blockquote><p>"The very experts who could kind of inform everyone else don't. They actually keep feeding them the information they already know because that helps establish a connection," <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~nfast/">Nathanael Fast</a> says.<p>If this whole argument seems circular, that's the point. Prominent people stay popular for longer than they ought to because they serve as conversational fodder, which in turn drives more media coverage.<p>"Take Paris Hilton, somehow or another she became well known and now people are more likely to talk about her," Fast says.</blockquote><p>This supports <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/node/641124/print">Duncan Watts</a>'s <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/emba/watt3.pdf">experimental work</a> on self-feeding fame.<p>But there is another component to this as well - that we perceive celebrities as part of our social group - they take up one of the slots we have available for modelling and keeping track of other people. My first experience of this was when I worked at BBC Elstree, and said hi to some oldish chap I recognised in the corridor, later realising that he didn't know me at all - he was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Fowler">Arthur from EastEnders</a>. (Now I've done a bit of public speaking this happens to me in reverse now and then - people who've seen me speak somewhere later on come and say hello, remembering it as a conversation). danah's classic <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/FriendsterMySpaceEssay.html">Fakesters discussion</a> touches on this too, with Friendster's symmetric Dunbar assumptions confounded by users wanting to connect through the famous; whereas MySpace and <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">especially Twitter</a> have embraced the fundamental asymmetry of who pays attention to whom in this way.<p>My take is that while Doc is right about the time-sink of celebrity for it's own sake, which may be an example of losing a useful person-slot to a synthetic creation. Mary's implication that there is a God-slot there is perhaps supported by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200904/globalization-religion">Robert Wright's</a> argument that the God as human-like role model can have good influences on us.<p>Certainly, being aware of our own choices of 'fake friends' to act as role models is likely to be better than having to choose them from a limited 20th century media model.

  <span class="p-name">Farewell to Google</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I'm no longer working for Google. I had an interesting time there and worked on lots of fascinating projects with great colleagues, so this is a small look back at some of them. <p>My first taste of Google was to work on <a href="http://orkut.com" >orkut</a>, before starting the project now known as <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles">Google Profiles</a>, which was first launched in <a ref="http://www.google.com/profiles" >Google Maps</a>, and is now seen across Google and the <a href="http://google.com/friendconnect" >wider web</a>. I then worked on the engineering side of <a href="http://opensocial.org" >OpenSocial</a>, before its <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=6911" >launch</a>. Realising that Google had thousands of engineers, but very few comfortable speaking in public, I became a Developer Advocate, working to bridge external and internal developers, <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/02/social-cloud.html" >explaining</a> the Social web to Google and OpenSocial and more to the wider web community. <p>I've spent most of my time working on building and promoting open web standards, both inside the company and out.

As I said in <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/02/social-cloud.html">The Social Cloud</a>, and stressed again last week at Ignite I/O, <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html">Douglas Adams got this right 10 years ago</a>:<br /><blockquote>Of course you can’t ‘trust’ what people tell you on the web anymore than you can ‘trust’ what people tell you on megaphones, postcards or in restaurants. Working out the social politics of who you can trust and why is, quite literally, what a very large part of our brain has evolved to do.</blockquote><br />Trying to model these trust relationships in the computer is fraught with hubris and failure, but what we can do is associate information with people, and display the information from people we know, with their pictures (and names) next to it. Then, our brains can apply the subtle modelling of trust relationships that they have evolved to do so well.<br />Making faces bigger onscreen lets us blend the two modes of computation smoothly, and filter and understand the world better through our nuanced understanding of trust.<br /><iframe src='http://docs.google.com/EmbedSlideshow?id=dfng2zqx_6cr559xhb' frameborder='0' width='410' height='342'></iframe>

  <p><a href="http://www.mmdnewswire.com/twitter-brain-damage-5086.html">NEW YORK, NY (MMD Newswire) May 13, 2009</a> -- Social media expert and author David Seaman claims that frequent Press Release use causes the "equivalent of brain damage".<br />"We're seeing thirty and forty year olds acting like overly emotional teenagers on MMD Newswire," Seaman said. "It's not all that healthy."<p>Press release use also takes complex ideas and boils them down into "overly simplistic soundbites" according to Seaman.<p>"Basically, press releases have some good uses, but they're making us all a bit stupider."

  <span class="p-name">WSJ dubbed internet parasite by WSJ editor</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  COMPANIES that publish mainstream people's interviews without paying a fee are the "parasites or tech tapeworms in the intestines of the internet" and will soon be challenged, Robert Thomson, the Australian-born editor of The Wall Street Journal <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,25293711-7582,00.html">has warned</a>.<br /><br />Thomson, who was holidaying in Australia last week, said companies such as The Wall Street Journal were profiting from the "mistaken perception" that content should be free.<br /><br />"There is a collective consciousness among interviewees that they are bearing the costs and that others are reaping some of the revenues — inevitably that profound contradiction will be a catalyst for action and the moment is nigh," he told Media.<br /><br />"There is no doubt that certain websites are best described as parasites or tech tapeworms in the intestines of the internet."<br /><br />Thomson, a former editor of The Times who was appointed editor-in-chief of Dow Jones and managing editor of The Wall Street Journal last May, said consumers must understand why they were paying a premium for content.<br /><br />"It's certainly true that newspapers have been socialised — wrongly I believe — that interviewees should be grateful," he said.<br /><br />"And there is no doubt that's in the interest of papers like the WSJ who have profited from that mistaken perception. And they have little incentive to recognise the value they are trading on that's created by others."<br /><br />Thomson said The Wall Street Journal benefited from interviewing people from Google and other companies.<br /><br />"The Wall Street Journal argues they drive attention to companies, but the whole WSJ sensibility is inimical to traditional brand loyalty," he said.<br /><br />"The Wall Street Journal encourages exclusivity — and shamelessly so — and therefore a significant proportion of their readers don't necessarily associate that comment with the interviewee.<br /><br />"Therefore revenue that should be associated with the interviewee is not garnered."<br /><br />In contrast, Thomson noted Google's YouTube service shared advertising revenues with its content providers. "The model is entirely different and certainly proper," he said.<br /><br />Thomson argued newspapers "need to be honest in their role as deliverers of other people's ideas". And as those sites were exploiting the value of mainstream business thought, "we have to be at least as clever as they are in understanding the value of our own filler".<br /><br />He said "quite a few writers are ready to have a serious discussion about whose content it is anyway".<br /><br />Meantime Thomson said it was "amusing" to read newspaper editorial and review sites, all of which traded on other people's information.<br /><br />"They are basically editorial echo chambers rather than centres of creation, and the cynicism they have about so-called business thinking is only matched by their opportunism in exploiting the quality of traditional companies," he said. <br /><br />Thomson also said it was incumbent on content creators to make their own websites compelling for readers. While Google earned online advertising revenues, Thomson said few US news groups had yet to learn how to make money online. <br /><br />"Papers should look at what their assets are -- is it their people? What is their role in any given society? And how do those assets play on the web? So how do we create an experience for readers using those assets which is clearly a premium experience? <br /><br />"And if you think that through starting from first principles rather than from an existing business view, there are opportunities. But I'll leave it to others to figure out what they may be."

  Feel the need to tell everyone everything what to think all of the time? <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7cAS_dEul22MlEtRFhabkc0a2c/aloadoftwitter.pdf">Then a newspaper column is for you</a><br /><br />Launched in 1821, The Sunday Times is the inescapable, old tech product. It boasts 1.2m readers — teeny compared to the BBC World Services's 183m — but its audience has slumped in the past year. <br /><br />Right now, the Australia-based company that owns The Sunday Times is valued at $29billion, even though, in start-up argot, it is “pre-revenue”. Despite the big losses and the ennui swirling around his product, Murdoch (who also coined the term “Digger”) has admitted many are bewildered when they first encounter The Sunday Times. “We’ve heard time and time again: ‘I really don’t get it — why would anyone read it?’ ”<br /><br />It’s a fair question. What kind of person shares opinion with the world the minute they get it? And just who are the “readers” willing to tune into this weekly news service of the ego?<br /><br />The clinical psychologist Oliver James has his reservations. “Being quoted in the Times stems from a lack of identity. It’s a constant update of who you are, what you are, where you are. Nobody would talk to them if they had a strong sense of identity.”<br /><br />“We are the most narcissistic age ever,” agrees Dr David Lewis, a cognitive neuropsychologist and director of research based at the University of Sussex. “Being quoted about something you don't use suggests a level of insecurity whereby, unless people recognise you, you cease to exist. It may stave off insecurity in the short term, but it won’t cure it.”<br /><br />For Alain de Botton, author of Status Anxiety and the forthcoming The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work, the Sunday Times represents “a way of making sure you are permanently connected to somebody and somebody is permanently connected to you, proving that you are alive. It’s like when a parent goes into a child’s room to check the child is still breathing. It is a giant baby monitor.”<br /><br />Is that why columns are often so breathtakingly mundane? Recently, the writer Giles Hattersley filed one saying: “unless my mother has been keeping a dark secret, I am not Roy Hattersley’s son” Who wants to tell the world that? “The primary fantasy for most people is that we can be as connected as we were in the womb, a situation of total closeness,” says de Botton. “When people who are very close are talking, they ‘witter away’: ‘It’s a bit dusty here’ or ‘There’s a squirrel in the garden.’ They don’t say, ‘What do you think of Descartes’s second treatise?’ It doesn’t matter what people say in their columns — it’s not the point.”<br /><br />“Columns are really just a series of symbols,” says Lewis. “The person writing it just wants to be in the forefront of your mind, nothing more.” Which makes it very unappealing to marketeers. <br /><br />“Reading a column is like a friend whispering something in your ear,” says de Botton. “We all want people to whisper secret messages to us. Children like to play ‘I have a secret to tell you’. It’s great fun, but what they say is often not very important.”<br /><br />“To ‘publish’ someone is to have a fantasy of who this person you’re publishing is, and you use it as a map reference or signpost to guide your own life because you are lost,” says James. “I would guess that the typical profile of a ‘publisher’ is someone who is old and who feels marginalised, empty and pointless. They don’t have an inner life,” he says.<br /><br />“It makes us look decrepit. And that is a high-status position in this society,” says de Botton. “Perhaps closeness is not always possible, or desirable. Being a rent-a-quote gives us another option. It says: I want to be in contact with you, but not too much. It’s the equivalent of sending a postcard.”

  <span class="p-name">Mark Cuban's Big Lie</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2009/01/27/the-great-internet-video-lie">Mark Cuban assumes</a> that Live Video - everyone forced to watch the same thing at once - is the goal. But <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/01/live-tv-is-dead-and-were-noticing.html">Live TV is dead</a>.<br />This is old media thinking writ large. People pay for products - Tivo, DVRs, iPods, TV series DVDs - that turn streams into files they can watch when they want to.<br />We've solved <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/04/video-on-net-is-solved-problem-many.html">how to send video over the net</a> many times already.<p><br />The rare cases where millions of people want to watch the same thing at once — Presidential Inaugurations or faux Gladiatorial contests like American Idol, the World Cup Final or the Superbowl — are great uses for broadcast TV or satellite, and lousy uses of the net. What works is watching the event <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2004/10/heckling-debate-in-irc.html">with friends on IRC</a> or Twitter or a social network, sharing comments. That's what you need to stream over the net with low latency.<p><br />Cuban is conveying the last gasp of the self-important TV broadcast mentality that dreams of intoning "here we are, live to the nation", and all we can do is listen. But we can all talk back in parallel now, and build our own narratives with <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">our own publics</a>. That's what the net is for. As Douglas Adams <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html">put it last century</a>:<br /><blockquote>I expect that history will show ‘normal’ mainstream twentieth century media to be the aberration in all this.<p>‘Please, miss, you mean they could only just sit there and watch? They couldn’t do anything? Didn’t everybody feel terribly isolated or alienated or ignored?’<p>‘Yes, child, that’s why they all went mad. Before the Restoration.’<p>‘What was the Restoration again, please, miss?’<p>‘The end of the twentieth century, child. When we started to get interactivity back.’</blockquote>

Detailed permissions - a UX nightmare<br />says @charleneli: remember when people didn't trust callerID? Now if you turn it off, people won't take your call<br />says @charleneli: setting up lists of who can see your pictures is a pain - have to categorize people - reclassifying is hard<br />says @charleneli: there's a need to better articulate and detect sub-groups of friends so this is less of a chore<br />I pointed out the power of asymmetric friending eg <a href="http://bit.ly/publics">http://bit.ly/publics</a> and @charleneli and audience agreed that it reduces awkwardness<br />says @charleneli: people will pay real money for virtual gifts<br />[ChrisSaad @kevinmarks asymmetic is good, the term friending is not great. I prefer follow or subscribe ]<br />@<a href="http://twitter.com/ChrisSaad">ChrisSaad</a> agreed "following" is a better term for this<br />Audience: when will people profit from us using their profiles? @charleneli says we all have our own CPMs<br />[clynetic @kevinmarks What is CPM?]<br />@<a href="http://twitter.com/clynetic">clynetic</a> CPM is marketingspeak for 'cost per thousand' - I suppose CPA ( cost per action) is better<br />says @charleneli: don't give up your social capital for short term gain me: don't be the Amway guy at the party<br />says @charleneli: behavioural targetting is often faulty, as behaviours change<br />says @charleneli: social media advertising experiments are waiting for turnaround<br />says @charleneli: GYM (Hotmail for M) will test social media integration with webmail<br />says @charleneli: Facebook Connect and Open Stack gaining traction with media co's<br />says @charleneli: Social shopping experiments start - we want our friends recommendations<br />says @charleneli: identify where social network data and content shoudl be integrated in your sites<br />says @charleneli: leverage existing identity and social graphs where your audience is<br />says @charleneli: get your privacy and permission policies aligned with an open strategy<br />says @charleneli: find your trust agents - in google I trust? do you trust facebook?<br />says @charleneli: the media buyers are still trying to buy demographics or content, not better targetting

  <p>The <a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article5489134.ece">Times</a> and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/google/4217055/Two-Google-searches-produce-same-CO2-as-boiling-a-kettle.html">Telegraph</a> have picked on some rather dubious stats on Google energy use:<br /><blockquote>a typical search generates about 7g of CO<sub>2</sub> Boiling a kettle generates about 15g</blockquote> but<br /><blockquote>Wissner-Gross has also calculated the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions caused by individual use of the internet. His research indicates that viewing a simple web page generates about 0.02g of CO<sub>2</sub> per second. This rises tenfold to about 0.2g of CO<sub>2</sub> a second when viewing a website with complex images, animations or videos.</blockquote><br /><p>So client-side, a search costs 0.02g/s - to get to 7g you look at it for 350s, or nearly 6 minutes. But hang on:<br /><blockquote>A separate estimate from John Buckley, managing director of carbonfootprint.com, a British environmental consultancy, puts the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of a Google search at between 1g and 10g, depending on whether you have to start your PC or not. Simply running a PC generates between 40g and 80g per hour, he says. of CO<sub>2</sub> Chris Goodall, author of Ten Technologies to Save the Planet, estimates the carbon emissions of a Google search at 7g to 10g (assuming 15 minutes’ computer use).</blockquote><br /><p>He's using it for 15 minutes per search? That gives 0.01g/s, or half the other chap's estimate.<br /><p>Google's data centre's are <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/green/energy/reducing.html">carbon neutral</a>, so it is only the client end you do have to worry about. However, breathing generates about 6g of Carbon every 10 minutes. Or about as much as they estimate computers do.<p>So I suggest you hold your breath while you search Google, to offset your carbon use. As searches return in well under a second, whatever these newspapers say, this shouldn't be any hardship. Or search from your Android or iPhone instead.<br /><p>Update: <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html">Urs Hölzle gives some actual figures for searches energy use</a>

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/01/macworld_expo_predictions">John Gruber</a> says "all Mac-related web sites must publish pre-Macworld Expo predictions regarding what Apple may announce at the show."<p><br />What I have is not so much predictions as an "I hope they've been thinking along the same lines I have" wishlist.</p><p><ul><li>An HD or better laptop. 17" if you must, but I'd like a 15" or smaller. The iPod Nano has 204 pixels per inch and a beautiful display. A 1920x1200 screen at that density would be 7" diagonal, or at iPhone's 163 ppi it would be 8.8" - there's plenty of room. You could get the 30" display's 2560x1600 into a 13" screen at iPhone ppi.</li><li>Come to that, a 7" diagonal HD iPhone/ iPod Touch would be lovely too. Not just for video, but for reading the web and facing-page PDF's on. Give it Bluetooth keyboard support.</li><li>Obviously, a new Mac Mini. I have a big shiny Sony HD TV and I want a little Mac to drive it (are you getting the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/08/apples-hd-future.html">HD theme</a> here yet?)</li><li>Separate out the phone crap. I don't like phones, and holding screens to my ear is daft anyway. Make the earpiece separate naturally. Come to that, negotiate me a data plan without a calling plan with your carrier buddies. Amazon did it for Kindle. And for goodness sake ship iChat for the handhelds. Put a camera on the top of the screen like the Macs all have.</li><li><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10131761-93.html">Drop DRM</a> already. For videos too. And HDCP. </li><li>Extend your <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB167LL/A?fnode=MTY1NDA1Mg&amp;mco=MjE0Njk2Mg">lovely bluetooth keyboard</a> to have a trackpad too. Make it work with iPhones and the new 7" HD iPod too.</li><li>one more thing -  Phil Schiller, stop charging for QuickTime Pro. Admit <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/01/how-apple-lost-its-web-video-mojo-and.html">the mistake you made ten years ago</a> and make video editing natural again. </li></ul></p>

  <span class="p-name">Cycling to new layers of freedom</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Dave Winer used the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/google-friend-connect-now-available.html">public beta of Google Friend Connect</a> to <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/12/04/soonItWillBeTimeToStartOve.html">reflect on tech industry cycles</a>:<blockquote>A new generation of young techies comes along, takes a look at the current stack, finds it too daunting (rightly so) and decides to start over from scratch. They find that they can make things happen that the previous generation couldn't cause they were so mired in the complexity of the systems they had built. The new systems become popular with "power users" -- people who yearn to overcome the limits of the previous generation. It's exhilirating! [...]<br />The trick in each cycle is to fight complexity, so the growth can keep going. But you can't keep it out, engineers like complexity, not just because it provides them job security, also because they really just like it. But once the stack gets too arcane, the next generation throws their hands up and says "We're not going to deal with that mess."</blockquote><br /><p>Now, I may be a few years behind Dave, but I think he is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, or the stack out with the cycle here. Back when I started out, to get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">my computer</a> to generate sound, I had to make my own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-Analog_Converter">D to A converter</a> to attach to the parallel port, and for non-character graphics, my hardware hacker friends swapped the character generator ROM for RAM, and I had to code in assembler to swap the display data in time.<p>Now my son thinks nothing of <a href="http://funnystories.blogspot.com/2008/12/new-composition-sky-high-view-of-utopia.html">mixing 10 polyphonic Midi tracks in an afternoon</a> or editing hi-def video (and yes, it's on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.4">OS</a> I helped to make capable of that).<p>Dave's revolutionary impulsiveness has a germ of truth, but what really happens is that successful technologies become invisible infrastructure for the next things that build on them. <p> I no longer need to write assembler, heck I no longer need to write C code. Dave's very URL - scripting.com - shows how we have built up layers of utility to work upon.<p>HTTP, HTML, JSON, Atom and Javascript are <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2008/12/07/rethinking-out-loud-about-infrastructure/">infrastructure</a> now. Our deepest role as developers is to build the invisible infrastructure for the next generation to take for granted, so they imagine new abstractions atop that. Dave did it with feeds.<p>What we're doing with the Open Stack — <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>, <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a>, <a href="http://portablecontacts.net/">PortableContacts</a> and <a href="http://www.opensocial.org/">OpenSocial</a>— is part of this evolutionary cycle too. We're combining building blocks into a simplified whole that makes sense to people who want their websites to <a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect/">become social</a>.<p>It comes down to what you can take for granted as the baseline to build the next exciting cycle on.

Now<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/13/28160/">, a year on</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/13/open-social-turns-one-my-how-youve-grown/">over 600 million social network users</a> can use OpenSocial applications in their preferred social network sites.<br />Then, applications had to be embedded in sites as gadgets, which makes the social context clear for users, but means developers have to write some Javascript, and can only run code when the user is looking at the site.<br />With <a href="http://developer.myspace.com/Community/blogs/devteam/archive/2008/11/12/opensocial-and-0-8.aspx">OpenSocial 0.8 rolling out</a>, the <a href="http://www.opensocial.org/Home/sharing-and-accessing-social-data">REST APIs</a> mean that developers can integrate with social sites using server-side code directly, potentially delegating user registration, profiles and friend relationships to an already-trusted social site, and feeding activity updates back into them.<br />To do this, we are building an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/56624456@N00/3020508770/">Open Stack</a>, based on <a href="http://openid.org">OpenID</a>, XRDS-Simple, <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a>, <a href="http://portablecontacts.net">PortableContacts</a> and OpenSocial. By composing open standards in this way, we can make each one more valuable. The <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/11/missing-point-of-openid.html">advantages of OpenID over email login in itself</a> are not that obvious to users, but if the OpenID can be used to bring in your profile and contacts data - with your permission via OAuth - suddenly the added value is clear to users and developers alike. This connection was one of the exciting discussions at the <a href="http://iiw.idcommons.net/Iiw2008b">Internet Identity Workshop</a> this week - here's a <a href="http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/11/13/the-open-stack-discussed-at-internet-identity-workshop/">video of myself, Steve Gillmor, David Recordon and Cliff Gerrish talking about it</a>.<br clear="all" />

  <span class="p-name">Missing the point of OpenID</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I'm puzzled by <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/11/07/WhyGoogleForkedOpenIDAndOtherStories.aspx">Dare's post on OpenID</a>, as he is wilfully misunderstanding its advantages at each stage, and I know he's smarter than that. He gets it right that OpenID is a way to confirm that a user owns a URL, without the rigmarole required to do so for an email address. <br /><br />However, the then uses his unmemorable Facebook URL http://www.facebook.com/p/Dare_Obasanjo/500050028 as an example, rather than any of the memorable ones he actually uses and people refer to, such as http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/ or http://carnage4life.spaces.live.com/ or http://twitter.com/Carnage4Life <br /><br />DeWitt Clinton did an excellent job of clearing up some of <a href="http://blog.unto.net/miscellaneous/clearing-up-inaccuracies-about-the-google-openid-idp-launch/">Dare's other innaccuracies</a>, but he then rhetorically exaggerated thus:<blockquote>URLs make fantastic identifiers — for the 0.1% of the web population that understands that they “are” a URL. Fortunately, the other 99.9% of the world (our parents, for example) already understand that they have an email address.</blockquote><br />This is missing the huge population of the online world (our children, for example) who consider email a messy noisy way to talk to old people, or to sign up to services when forced to, but are happy using their MySpace or Bebo or Hi5 or LiveJournal or Blogger or Twitter URLs to refer to themselves.<br />As I said in <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/01/urls-are-people-too.html">URLs are People Too</a>:<blockquote>The underlying thing that is wrong with an email address is that it's affordance is backwards - it enables people who have it to send things to you, but there's no reliable way to know that a message is from you. Conversely, URLs have the opposite default affordance- people can go look at them and see what you have said about yourself, and computers can go and visit them and discover other ways to interact with what you have published, or ask you permission for more.</blockquote><br />Where I see OpenID providing a key advantage is in it's coupling with URL-based endpoints that provide more information and save the user time. The OpenID to <a href="http://portablecontacts.net/">PortableContacts</a> connection <a href="http://portablecontactsdemo.janrain.com/">as demonstrated by janrain</a> can add your friends (with permission) from an OpenID login directly via OAuth.<br />This makes the OpenID login instantly more useful than an email one, and by connecting to an OpenSocial endpoint too, you can couple activities you take on the wider web with the site you trust to be a custodian of your profile and friends data, so your friends can discover what you are doing elsewhere, and come and join you.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to talking through these issues at <a href="http://iiw.idcommons.net/Iiw2008b">Internet Identity World</a> next week in Mountain View.

  <span class="p-name">Blogging's not dead, it's becoming like air</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>One thing I learned at Technorati is that one sure-fire way to get linked to by bloggers is to write an article about blogging. Sure enough, <a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12566826">The Economist</a> and <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/11/who_killed_the.php">Nick Carr</a> have, with their 'death of the blogosphere' articles, garnered a fair bit of linkage.</p><p>Their curious obsession with the Technorati Top 100 is missing what is really happening. As <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2008/11/08/i-said-the-fly/">JP</a> points out, the old blogging crew are still around, they're just blogging less that those paid to do so a dozen times a day. Not because they are less interested or engaged, but because there are now many new ways to do what we used blogs for back then. </p><p>In 2001, if we wanted to share brief thoughts, we <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2001/11/07">used a blog</a>; to link to others’ posts, we <a href="http://www.pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/oldarchives/2001_11_04_instapundit_archive.html">used a blog</a>. If we wanted a group discussion, we made a <a href="http://gonzoengaged.blogspot.com/2002_01_27_archive.html#9139273">group blog</a>.</p><p>With Technorati, and trackback and pingback, we built tools to follow cross-blog conversations, and learned that we are each others’ media. As I <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2004/07/call-off-search.html">wrote in 2004</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The great thing about weblogs is when you discover someone. Someone who makes sense to you, or someone who surprises you with a viewpoint you hadn't thought of. Once you have found them you can subscribe to their feeds and see how they can keep inspiring or surprising you.<br />You can even start a blog, link to them, and join the conversation</p></blockquote><p>A year later <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005/05/my-tail-is-longer-than-yours.html">I reiterated</a>:</p><blockquote><p>By tracking people linking to me or mentioning my name, Technorati helps me in this distributed asynchronous conversation (thats how I found Mike and Dave's comments, after all). However, as I've said before, "I can read your thoughts, as long as you write them down first". In order to be in the conversation, you need to be writing and linking. Perforce, this means that those who write and link more, and are written about and linked to more, are those who most see the utility of it.</p></blockquote><p>What has happened since is that the practices of blogging have become reified into mainstream usage. Through social networks and <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinmarks">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/03474483732051894197/state/com.google/broadcast">Reader shared items</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmarks/">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://huffduffer.com/kevinmarks">HuffDuffer</a> and all the other nicely-focused gesture spreading tools we have, the practice of blogging, of mediating the world for each other, has become part of the fabric of the net.<br />This may be the first blogpost I've written since August, but the many <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">digital publics</a> I'm part of have been flowing media and friendly gestures to and from me all the time. </p>

  <span class="p-name">Social Disease, or making magic?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://strange.corante.com/archives/2008/08/02/is_the_problem_social.php">Suw is musing thoughtfully on the overtones of describing something as ‘social’</a>:<blockquote><p>Monica thanked me for the explanation, saying that she was glad I had elaborated as she had thought, and I hope she forgives me for paraphrasing, that 'social software was something awful, like social workers'. That really made me think, and I haven't quite got to the end of where that throwaway comment has led me.<p>Is 'social' the problem with social software? Certainly in the UK, 'social' has some rather negative connotations: Social workers are often despised and derided as interfering, and often incompetent, busybodies. Social housing is where you put people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap. Social sciences are the humanities trying to sound important by putting on sciency airs. Social climbers are people who know how to suck their way up the ladder. Social engineering is getting your way deviously, by using people's weaknesses against them. Social security is money you give people who can't be bother work for themselves. Socialism is an inherently flawed system that is prone to corruption. Social disease is venereal.</blockquote><br />This reminds me of <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003/04/social-software-again.html">early in the Social Sofware story</a>:<blockquote>The SSA meeting was fairly chaotic - perhaps reflecting the diverse meanings of 'Social'. Clay Shirky did not show up (or if he did, did not speak up); Dave Winer later poured scorn on the efforts, implying it was all about social climbing. <p>Friedrich Hayek famously said that the word 'social' empties the noun it is applied to of their meaning. Hayek goes on: <blockquote>...it has in fact become the most harmful instance of what, after Shakespeare's 'I can suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs' ( As You Like It , II, 5), some Americans call a 'weasel word'. As a weasel is alleged to be able to empty an egg without leaving a visible sign, so can these words deprive of content any term to which they are prefixed while seemingly leaving them untouched. A weasel word is used to draw the teeth from a concept one is obliged to employ, but from which one wishes to eliminate all implications that challenge one's ideological premises.</blockquote></blockquote><p><br />Perhaps the problem is that the social realm is the realm of trust, so saying things are social is asserting "trust me". As <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/17/080317fa_fact_gopnik?currentPage=all">Adam Gopnik writes on magic in the New Yorker</a>:<br /><blockquote><p>But the Too Perfect theory has larger meanings, too. It reminds us that, whatever the context, the empathetic interchange between minds is satisfying only when it is “dynamic,” unfinished, unresolved. Friendships, flirtations, even love affairs depend, like magic tricks, on a constant exchange of incomplete but tantalizing information. We are always reducing the claim or raising the proof. The magician teaches us that romance lies in an unstable contest of minds that leaves us knowing it’s a trick but not which one it is, and being impressed by the other person’s ability to let the trickery go on.[...]<p>I saw, too, that David Blaine is absolutely sincere in his belief that the way forward for a young magician lies not in mastering the tricks but in mastering the mind of the modern age, with its relentless appetite for speed and for the sensational-dressed-as-the-real. And I thought I sensed in Swiss the urge to say what all of us would like to say—that traditions are not just encumbrances, that a novel is not news, that an essay is a different thing from an Internet rant, that techniques are the probity and ethic of magic, the real work. The crafts that we have mastered are, in part, the tricks that we have learned, and though we know how much knowledge the tricks enfold, still, tricks is what they are.</blockquote>

  <span class="p-name">Open Source and Social Cloud Computing</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Tim O'Reilly has written an excellent review post on <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/07/open-source-and-cloud-computing.html">Open Source and Cloud Computing</a> which says, among other things:<blockquote>The interoperable internet should be the platform, not any one vendor's private preserve.<p>So here's my first piece of advice: if you care about open source for the cloud, build on services that are designed to be federated rather than centralized. Architecture trumps licensing any time.<p>But peer-to-peer architectures aren't as important as open standards and protocols. If services are required to interoperate, competition is preserved. Despite all Microsoft and Netscape's efforts to "own" the web during the browser wars, they failed because Apache held the line on open standards. This is why the Open Web Foundation, announced last week at OScon, is putting an important stake in the ground. It's not just open source software for the web that we need, but open standards that will ensure that dominant players still have to play nice.<p>The "internet operating system" that I'm hoping to see evolve over the next few years will require developers to move away from thinking of their applications as endpoints, and more as re-usable components. For example, why does every application have to try to recreate its own social network? Shouldn't social networking be a system service?<p>This isn't just a "moral" appeal, but strategic advice.[...]<p><b>A key test of whether an API is open is whether it is used to enable services that are not hosted by the API provider</b>, and are distributed across the web. </blockquote><br /><p>I think this API openness test is not strong enough. As I wrote in <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/05/api-is-bespoke-suit-standard-is-t-shirt.html">An API is a bespoke suit, a standard is a t-shirt</a>, for me the key test is that implementations can interoperate without knowing of each others' existence, let alone having to have a business relationship. That's when you have an open spec.<p>The other thing I resist in the idea of an internet operating system is that that the net is composable, not monolithic. You can swap in and implementations of different pieces, and combine different specs that solve one piece of the problem without having to be connected to everything else.<p>The original point of the cloud was a solved piece of the problem that means you don't have to worry about the internal implementation.<p>Thus, the answer to "shouldn't social networking be a system service?" is yes, it should be a <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/02/social-cloud.html">Social Cloud</a>. That's exactly what we are working on in <a href="http://www.opensocial.org/">OpenSocial</a>.

  <span class="p-name">Here Comes Everybody - Tummlers, Geishas, Animateurs and Chief Conversation Officers help us listen</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100511">Bob Garfield's</a> de haut en bas attack on web commenters upset two very skilled conversational catalysts, <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/episodes/2008/07/25/segments/104537">Ira Glass</a>, and <a href="http://powazek.com/posts/1040">Derek Powazek</a>. The false dichotomy of 'we choose who you get to hear' and 'total anarchic mob noise' was dismissed by <a href="http://www.jacklail.com/blog/archives/2008/07/improve-this-post-with-comment.html">Jack Lail</a> too. At the same time, <a href="http://www.links.org/?p=351">Ben Laurie explained</a> how the IETF's open-to-all mailing lists can be hijacked by time-rich fools, talking about the <a href="http://openwebfoundation.org/">Open Web Foundation</a>. <br /><p>At <a href="http://www.supernova2008.com">Supernova</a> last month, listening to <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a> talk about the <a href="http://conversationhub.com/2008/06/16/interview-with-clay-shirky/">problems of collective action</a> reminded me of a small nit I have with his excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0385520808%26tag=epeusepigone-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1594201536%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Here Comes Everybody</a> (which you should all read). He talks about the deep changes that ridiculously easy group forming online has wrought, but he also explains that most of these groups fail, in various ways.<p>The key to this is finding people who play the role of conversational catalyst within a group, to welcome newcomers, rein in old hands and set the tone of the conversation so that it can become a community. Clay referred to <a href="http://www.nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/">Teresa Nielsen-Hayden</a>, who is a great example of this, and I have had the privilege to discuss this with Teresa, Amy Muller,<a href="http://www.instructables.com/member/canida/">Christy Canida</a> and others at the <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/03/troll-whispering-at-web2open.html">Troll Whispering</a> session at Web2Open, and heard very similar stories from Gina Trapini, Annalee Newitz, Jessamyn West and Jeska Dzwigalski at <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/blogs/podcasts.php/2008/04/09/users_are_revolting">The Users Are Revolting</a> at SXSW.<p>The communities that fail, whether dying out from apathy or being overwhelmed by noise, are the ones that don't have someone there cherishing the conversation, setting the tone, creating a space to speak, and rapidly segregating those intent on damage. The big problem with have is that we don't have a English name for this role; they get called 'Moderators' (as <a href="http://www.everythinginmoderation.org/2003/10/index.shtml">Tom Coates thoroughly described</a>) or '<a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/essential-skills-of-a-community-manager/">Community</a> <a href="http://arielwaldman.com/2008/05/23/twitter-responds/">Managers</a>', and because when they're doing it right you see everyone's conversation, not their carefully crafted atmosphere, their role is often ignored.<p>In other languages there are words closer to this role - <a href="http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/7/19/108121.html">Suw and I thought of <i>geisha</i></a> a while back, whereas Teresa suggested the Yiddish <i>Tummler</i> - both <a href="http://www.deborahschultz.com/">Deb Schultz</a> and <a href="http://heathergold.com/">Heather Gold</a> liked that one. In French <i>animateur</i> has the broader connotations of discussion, leadership and guidance needed, but in English we are stuck with enervated latinate words like <i>facilitator</i>. Even an <a href="http://www.edwoj.com/Alinsky/AlinskyObamaChapter1990.htm">eloquent and charismatic presidential candidate</a>had a difficult time explaining what a 'Community Organizer' does, around the same time that <a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm">Bartlett was resorting to card tricks</a>.<p>Which brings me back to Clay's book - in it he gives an account of the #joiito chatroom that completely misses the rôle that JeannieCool played there, making her sound like a n00b. The software tool, jibot, that has helped keep that conversation going for 5 years, was <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003/07/social-botware.html">built to support Jeannie's role as conversational catalyst</a>. I do hope he gets a chance to correct this in the next edition.<p>The broader issue is one that we are still working on - building rules for <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003/04/emergent-aristocracy.html">who gets to speak where and when</a>, re-imagining the historic model of a single hegemonic public record that print Journalism still aspires to, from its roots in the coffeeshops of London into the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">many parallel publics we see on the web</a>, and how <a href="http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=1109">legal precedents designed for a monopoly of speech make no sense here</a>.<p>In the meantime, if your <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/">newspaper</a>, <a href="http://strange.corante.com/archives/2008/07/23/required_reading_for_public_media_executives_and_programme_makers.php">social media initiative</a> or <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/07/28/comments-on-comments-on-comments/">website</a> isn't working right, you need to find your tummler, geisha, animateur or conversational catalyst, but you should consider giving them a big name title like 'Chief Conversation Officer'.

  <span class="p-name">Shortening URLs, or getting inbetween?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>With the rise of short message systems like Twitter, there is a growth in URL shorteners (as each one's namespace gets full, others get shorter). Today <a href="http://bit.ly">bit.ly</a> launched to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/bitly_alternative_to_tinyurl.php">big fanfare</a> in the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/07/08/bitlyLaunchesToday.html">blogosphere</a>.<p>I took a closer look. What I noticed is that the older generation of these - <a href="http://tinyurl.com">tinyurl.com</a> and<a href="http://xrl.us"> xrl.us</a> use a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.2">301 Moved Permanently</a> redirect, whereas <a href="http://bit.ly">bit.ly</a> and <a href="http://is.gd">is.gd</a> use a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3">302 Found</a> redirect, which means 'don't cache the redirected URL, keep checking the original'.<p>In other words, these services are saying in their HTTP responses that they may change what the short URLs point to in future, putting browsers, indexers and caches on notice that this may happen.<p>I also noticed that bit.ly, like tinyurl.com, allows you to pick a custom label from their namespace, but if you do it returns two 302 redirects in sequence (once to a more cryptic bit.ly url, then to the external one you chose). I pointed <a href="http://bit.ly/k">bit.ly/k</a> at this blog, so you can check it yourself with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>:<code><pre>$ curl --head http://bit.ly/k<br />HTTP/1.1 302 Found<br />Location: http://bit.ly/fwNKA<br /><br />$ curl --head http://bit.ly/fwNKA<br />HTTP/1.1 302 Found<br />Location: http://epeus.blogspot.com</pre></code><p><p>Apart from the extra delay this introduces, this is also telling your browser and web crawlers not to cache this, as they may change it in future. Compare tinyurl.com:<code><pre>$ curl --head http://tinyurl.com/kevinm<br />HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently<br />Location: http://epeus.blogspot.com</pre></code><p>Google's advice for webmasters is to <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=93633">use 301 for redirects</a>, as this signals the preferred URL.

  <span class="p-name">Google as a restaurant? Watch Gordon Ramsay</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/06/30/googlicious/">Jeff Jarvis</a> says he's writing a metaphorical application of Google principles to running a restaurant. Over the last few weekends, while sorting out stuff at home, I've been watching <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/154/index.jsp">Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</a> which BBC America seems to be playing continuously at weekends. If you haven't seen it, do watch some - each episode, Ramsay spends a week at a failing restaurant in the UK and tries to help them turn it around. <p>After seeing a few, there are recurrent themes that Ramsay comes up with: simple menus, built on good ingredients that local people understand, served promptly. Which fits well with Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html">ten things</a> - simple frontend, low latency results, user-focused. How he tries these out involve analogues for user testing, A/B experiments, and profiling under high load. <p>Of course, Google does run restaurants - so Jeff can read how <a href="http://insanecats.com/cgi-bin/single.py?month=jun08&msg=27">they get built and tested</a> directly.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/gspeast2008/public/content/home">Graphing Social Patterns East</a> is on tomorrow, and I'm sorry not to be there, though <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/gspeast2008/public/schedule/speaker/2657">m'colleague Patrick Chanezon will be</a>.

  <span class="p-name">Miasma theory - wrong in the 1840s, wrong now</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  A couple of years ago <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/02/internet-regeneration.html">I wrote</a>:<blockquote>My generation draws the Internet as a cloud that connects everyone; the younger generation experiences it as oxygen that supports their digital lives. The old generation sees this as a poisonous gas that has leaked out of their pipes, and they want to seal it up again.</blockquote><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7421099.stm">Bill Thompson</a> and <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/05/miasma_computin.php">Nick Carr</a> are worried about governments interfering too:<blockquote>In the real world national borders, commercial rivalries and political imperatives all come into play, turning the cloud into a miasma as heavy with menace as the fog over the Grimpen Mire that concealed the Hound of the Baskervilles in Arthur Conan Doyle's story.</blockquote><p>Except, if you have read or listened to <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/">Steven Johnson's</a> excellent <a href="http://www.theghostmap.com/">The Ghost Map</a>, you'll know that the miasma theory of disease was a fatal error for urban England in the 1840s - the real problem was not the bad smells in the air, but the diseases in the water. The fault, dear governments, lies not in our clouds but in your pipes.

  <span class="p-name">An API is a bespoke suit, a standard is a t-shirt</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2008/05/no_api_you_suck.html">Brad is calling for APIs</a>, and even <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/new_york_times_api_coming.php">the NYT is proposing one</a>, but there is a problem with APIs that goes beyond <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/05/26/howToDoDataPortability.html">Dave's concern about availability</a>.<p>When a site designs an API, what they usually do is take their internal data model and expose every nook and cranny in it in great detail. Obviously, this fits their view of the world, or they wouldn't have built it that way, so they want to share this with everyone. In one way this is like the form-fitting lycra that weekend cyclists are so enamoured of, but working with such APIs is like being a <a href="http://www.englishcut.com/">bespoke tailor</a> - you have to measure them carefully, and cut your code exactly right to fit in with their shapes, and the effort is the same for every site you have to deal with (you get more skilled at it over time, but it is a craft nonetheless).<p>Conversely, when a site adopts a standard format for expressing their data, or how to interact with it, you can put your code together once, try it out on some conformance tests, and be sure it will work across a wide range of different sites - it's like designing a t-shirt for <a href="http://threadless.com/">threadless</a> instead.<p>Putting together such standards, like HTML5, OpenID, OAuth or OpenSocial or, for Dave's example of reviews, <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview">hReview</a>, takes <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/process">more thought and reflection</a> than just replicating your own internal data structures, but the payoff is that implementations can interoperate without knowing of each others' existence, let alone having to have a business relationship.<p>I had this experience at work recently, when the developers of the Korean Social network <a href="http://idtail.com">idtail</a> visited. I was expecting to talk to them about implementing OpenSocial on their site, but they said they had already implemented an OpenSocial container and apps using OpenID login, and built their own <a href="http://dev.idtail.com/docs/OpenSocial">developer site for Korean OpenSocial developers</a> from reading the <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/opensocial.org/opensocial/Technical-Resources">specification docs</a>.<p>I'm looking forward to more 'aha' moments like that this week at<a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/"> I/O.</a>

  <span class="p-name">Portable Apps, not data?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Brad Templeton has a post on <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/data-hosting-instead-data-portability">Data Hosting not Data Portability</a> that fits in neatly with <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=df9dfsgj_1ghhqgjfq">the VRM proposal</a> I <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/05/mixing-degrees-of-publicness-in-http.html">discussed yesterday</a>. In fact, what he describes is a great fit for <a href="http://opensocial.org/">OpenSocial</a>.<p>He says:<br /></p><blockquote>Your data host’s job is to perform actions on your data. Rather than giving copies of your data out to a thousand companies (the Facebook and Data Portability approach) you host the data and perform actions on it, programmed by those companies who are developing useful social applications.</blockquote><p>Which is exactly what an <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/container.html">OpenSocial container</a> does - mediate access to personal and friend data for 3rd party applications.</p><blockquote>This environment has complete access to the data, and can do anything with it that you want to authorize. The developers provide little applets which run on your data host and provide the functionality. Inside the virtual machine is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">Capability-based security </a>environment which precisely controls what the applets can see and do with it. </blockquote><p>This maps exactly on to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/">Caja</a>, the capability-based Javascript security model that is being used in OpenSocial.</p><blockquote>Your database would store your own personal data, and the data your connections have decided to reveal to you. In addition, you would subscribe to a feed of changes from all friends on their data. This allows applications that just run on your immediate social network to run entirely in the data hosting server.<br /></blockquote><p>Again, a good match for<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/docs/0.7/reference/opensocial.Activity.html"> OpenSocial's Activity Streams </a>(and don't forget <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/docs/0.7/spec.html#persistence">persistent app data on the server</a>).<br /><blockquote>Currently, <b>everybody</b> is copying your data, just as a matter of course. That’s the default. They would have to work very hard not to keep a copy. In the data hosting model, they would have to work extra hard, and maliciously, and in violation of contract, to make a copy of your data. Changing it from implicit to overt act can make all the difference.</blockquote><p>The situation is worse than that; asking people for their logins to other sites is widespread and dangerous. I'd hope Brad would support <a href="http://oauth.net">OAuth</a> as a step along the way to his more secure model - especially combined with the <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dc43mmng_2g6k9qzfb">REST APIs</a> that are part of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/opensocial-and-gadgets-spec/browse_thread/thread/94b6caabc80fc4d0#">OpenSocial 0.8</a><p>If you're interested in these aspects of OpenSocial, do join in the linked mailing lists, and come along to the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpensocialApiBlog/~3/284304629/opensocial-summit-may-14th-at.html">OpenSocial Summit on May 14th</a> (just down the road from <a href="http://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php/Iiw2008a">IIW</a>).

  <span class="p-name">Mixing degrees of publicness in HTTP</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  At the <a href="http://">Data Sharing Workshop </a>the other day, we had a discussion about how to combine OAuth and Feeds, which I was reminded of by <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/05/05/Changing-Your-Address">Tim Bray's discussion</a> of <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=df9dfsgj_1ghhqgjfq"> Adriana and Alec's VRM proposal</a> today.<br />The session was<a href="http://datasharingsummit.com/dsswiki/index.php?title=OAuth_%2B_Feeds"> tersely summarized here</a>, but let me recap the problem.<p>When you are browsing the web, you often encounter pages that show different things depending on who you are, such as blog, wikis, webmail or even banking sites. They do this by getting you to log in, and then using a client-side cookie to save you the bother of doing that every time. When you want to give a site access to another one's data (for example when letting <a href="http://www.flickr.com/import/people/">Flickr</a> check your <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/contacts/">Google Contacts </a> for friends), you need to give it a URL to look things up at.</p><p>The easy case is public data - then the site can just fetch it, or use a service that caches public data from several places, like the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">Social Graph API</a>. This is like a normal webpage, which is the same for everyone, returning a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.2.1">HTTP 200 response</a> with the data.</p><p>The other common case is where the data is private. <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> is a great way for you to delegate access to a web service for someone else, which is done by returning an <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.2">HTTP 401 response</a> with a <code>WWW-Authenticate: OAuth</code> header showing that authentication is needed. If the fetching site sends a valid <code>Authorization</code> header, it can have access to the data.</p><p>The tricky case is where there is useful data that can be returned to anyone with a 200, but additional information could be supplied to a caller with authentication (think of this like the social network case, where friends get to see your home phone number and address, but strangers just get your hometown). In this case, returning a 401 would be incorrect,as there is useful data there.</p><p>What struck me was that in this case, the server could return a 200, but include a <code>WWW-Authenticate: OAuth</code> header to indicate that more information is available if you authenticate correctly. This seems the minimal change that could support this duality, and much easier than requiring and signalling separate authenticated and unauthenticated endpoints through a HTML-level discovery model, or, worse, adding a new response to HTTP. What I'd like to know from people with deeper HTTP experience than me is whether this is viable, and is it likely to be benign for existing clients — will they choke on a 200 with a <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header?</p><p>HTTP does have a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.2.4">203 response</a> meaning Non-Authoritative Data, but I suspect returning that is more likely to have side effects.<br /></p>

  <span class="p-name">Digital publics, Conversations and Twitter</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Last week, I left the Web 2.0 conference to listen to <a href="http://www.itofisher.com/mito/weblog/">Mimi Ito</a>, <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/MacArthur2008.html">danah boyd</a> and <a href="http://digitalyouth.ischool.berkeley.edu/">their colleagues</a> talk about their research on Digital Publics.<p> Now if you haven't been paying attention, that plural of 'public' there may throw you. Surely things are either 'public' or 'private'? As danah explains:<blockquote><p>Just as context is destabilized through networked publics, so is the meaning of public and private. What I learned from talked to teens is that they are living in a world where things are "public by default, private when necessary." Teens see public acts amongst peers as being key to status. Writing a public message to someone on their wall is a way of validating them amongst their peers. Likewise, teens make choices to go private to avoid humiliating one of their friends.<p>Yet, their idea of public is not about all people across all space and all time. They want publics of peers, not publics where creeps and parents lurk.<p>Bly Lauritano-Werner (17, Maine): <blockquote>My mom always uses the excuse about the internet being 'public' when she defends herself. It's not like I do anything to be ashamed of, but a girl needs her privacy. I do online journals so I can communicate with my friends. Not so my mother could catch up on the latest gossip of my life.</blockquote><p>Properties of technology have complicated what it means to be in public. We are all used to being in publics that don't include all people across all space and all time. Many of us grew up gossiping with friends out in public and stopping the moment that an adult walks over. This isn't possible when things are persistent. And it's really hard to be public to all peers and just keep certain people out. So teens are learning how to negotiate a world where the very meaning of public and private have changed. Again, this is a good thing. They're going to need these skills in the future.</blockquote><p>The day before, at Web2Open, I had heard something similar in the <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/03/troll-whispering-at-web2open.html">Troll Whispering</a> session. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/member/canida">Christy Canida</a> explained that when someone posts something trollish or otherwise dubious on <a href="http://www.instructables.com">her site</a>, they get put in a state where only they can see their posts, but no-one else can (except Christy and the other conversation monitors). This damps down the flame responses until Christy and co have time to review, and maybe release them, but in their view the post is on the site, but no-one is responding.<p>This varying view of the web, depending on who you are, seems odd at first, but it is in fact a recognition in code of what actually exists in human attention. We don't all read the same web, we see <a href="http://nonzero.blogspot.com/2002_05_01_nonzero_archive.html#85083124">our own reflections</a> in what we seek through searches or filtered by our homophily-led reading.<p>Which is where Twitter comes in. <a href="http://blog.softtechvc.com/2008/04/twitter-where-n.html">Like Jeff</a>, I've been twittering more than blogging recently, and while immediacy is part of it, a far stronger thing is that I have a sense of public there - a public of people I <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinmarks">choose to follow</a> and who chose to follow me. Everyone who uses Twitter sees a different, semi-overlapping public, which maps closer to our individual idea of the digital public we are speaking to, and listening to; one that maps more closely what the socialogist and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1890951293%26tag=ws%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1890951293%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">theorists</a> have been describing for a while.

[...]Many excessive users consume more data than a business-class T1 line running at full capacity in a month. [T1 is 1.5 Mbit/sec - Comcast claims to offer 12 Mbit/sec for PowerBoost, and 6/8 Mbit/sec standard] [...] Currently, each month Comcast identifies the top bandwidth users of its High-Speed Internet service by determining aggregate data usage across its entire customer base nationwide. </blockquote><p>What they are saying is that they use a crude averaging model, and penalize you if you don't fit, for example by using the connection capacity they promise more than 10% of the time. Now, this could be called Procrustean, but it reminds me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Producers-Special-Zero-Mostel/dp/B00005JK45/">The Producers</a>, where Bialystock and Bloom sold a hundred people 10% shares of the show, assuming it would fail. Sadly for Comcast, people like Dave are finding new uses for the net's bandwidth, and not just checking email sporadically any more.<p>Conventional internet service user models are based on users downloading more then they upload, from common big media sites that can be easily cached. However, as <a href="http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_2/odlyzko/">Odlyzko pointed out</a>, citing <a href="http://www.lesk.com/mlesk/ksg97/ksg.html">Lesk's now decade-old work</a>, the dominant form of data creation is photographs. Now all these photographs are actually digital, and we want to share them so others can see them. Because we aren't allowed to run our own servers by the likes of Comcast, we have to upload them to Flickr or Photobucket or Picasa to share them. This gives us an 'upload more than you download' network flow, as we send them up at full multi-megapixel resolution, but browse a few of each others' at thumbnail or reduced size. And that's before we even consider video uploading (which I've noticed Comcast throttles at 0.4 Mbit/sec for me).<p>Comcast hit the news before by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=comcast+bittorrent+throttle">sabotaging Bittorrent transfers</a> by faking reset packets, but what Bittorrent is really doing is arbitraging around the asymmetric network bandwidth delivered by these outdated user models.<p>Bob Briscoe recently wrote an <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/bbriscoe/projects/2020comms/refb/draft-briscoe-tsvarea-fair-02.html">interesting proposal</a> on handling congestion by TCP signalling to reveal the costs of congestion. This was<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Ou/?p=1078"> spun by George Ou</a> as an attack on P2P protocols, but the underlying principle of penalising those who cause congestion is an interesting one. The question I'd like answered is that if I have a gigabit network at home, and the internet backbone is multi-terabit, when Comcast throttles my uploads to 400 kilobits, aren't they the ones causing the congestion?

  <span class="p-name">Be Organic, not Viral</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I just got back from the <a href="http://www.vlab.org/article.html?aid=172">VLAB Multi-platform Social Networking</a> event, which I thought was very interesting overall. <a href="www.web-strategist.com">Jeremiah Owyang</a> did a great moderating job, and Jia Shen, Sourabh Niyogi, Ken Gullicksen and Steve Cohen brought lots of different viewpoints to the discussion. Growing and deriving value from Apps within Social Networks is still full of lots of unknowns, but it was good to hear some basic shared principles come through - my summary of one point was 'before you think about a Business Model, make sure you have a Pleasure Model'.<p>Another point well made by Steve Cohen of Bebo was something I've been thinking for a while too - the hunger for 'Viral' growth is a mistake - what you really need is 'Organic' growth. Just as we distinguish between Organic search results and bought or spammed ones, social network sites and their users are distinguishing between the viral apps that are essentially parasitic, using their hosts as a means to their propagation, and the ones that organically become part of the social ecology, making both the site and the users richer by their presence.<br />I spent the last weekend fighting off a flu virus, partly by eating lots of organic fruit. I expect social networks and their users will continue to do the same.

  <span class="p-name">Sheet music redux</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I've long been involved with amateur theater and music performance (my boys are performing in a Schumann recital tomorrow with the rest of their piano teacher's pupils), and I grew up seeing double bass cases plastered with Musicians' Union "Keep Music Live" stickers around the place, but I always thought this was a luddite rearguard action against the tide of recorded media that began flowing about a century ago.<br />But this week, the news was that <a href="http://www.news.com/MTV-Rock-Band-sells-2.5-million-songs/2100-1043_3-6226743.html">Rock Band</a>  had sold 2.5 million downloaded songs for you to play along with (it comes with 58). <br />Having researched this thoroughly with my boys, the fun of this game is more in the playing than the listening — the 'guitar' playing is clearly simplified, though the drumming is pretty close to reality, and the less said about my 'singing' the better.<br />Looking at this in the longer view, it can be seen as the return of sheet music in a new form; before recordings took over, sheet music sold for amateur performers was the dominant form. Here's <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html">Douglas Adams again</a>:<br /><blockquote>during this century we have for the first time been dominated by non-interactive forms of entertainment: cinema, radio, recorded music and television. Before they came along all entertainment was interactive: theatre, music, sport – the performers and audience were there together, and even a respectfully silent audience exerted a powerful shaping presence on the unfolding of whatever drama they were there for. We didn’t need a special word for interactivity in the same way that we don’t (yet) need a special word for people with only one head.<br /><br />I expect that history will show ‘normal’ mainstream twentieth century media to be the aberration in all this. ‘Please, miss, you mean they could only just sit there and watch? They couldn’t do anything? Didn’t everybody feel terribly isolated or alienated or ignored?’<br /><br />‘Yes, child, that’s why they all went mad. Before the Restoration.’<br /><br />‘What was the Restoration again, please, miss?’<br /><br />‘The end of the twentieth century, child. When we started to get interactivity back.’<br /></blockquote>

  <span class="p-name">Fear of the new -  the Internet, Tea, and MapReduce</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/foreign/davidblair/jan2008/policing-internet.htm">Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6 said</a>:<blockquote><p>“Al-Qa’eda has prospered and as it were regrouped largely because of the energy and effort it has put into its propaganda, largely through the internet.”<p>Sir Richard added that the internet had become the main channel for “radicalisation” and coordination between al-Qa’eda cells. He said: “In dealing with this problem, there is no alternative to imposing significant controls over the internet.”</blockquote><br /><p>This is what I call the "cup of tea" problem, after<a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html"> Douglas Adams</a>:<blockquote>Newsreaders still feel it is worth a special and rather worrying mention if, for instance, a crime was planned by people 'over the Internet.' They don't bother to mention when criminals use the telephone or the M4, or discuss their dastardly plans 'over a cup of tea,' though each of these was new and controversial in their day. </blockquote><br /><p>Some people have been surprised that tea was controversial, but <a href="http://www.quite.com/misc/tea1.htm">William Cobbett's 1822 'The evils of tea (and the virtues of beer)' had this to say</a>:<blockquote>It must be evident to everyone, that the practice of tea drinking, must rended the frame feeble and unfit to encounter hard labour or severe weather, while, as I have shown, it deducts from the means of replenishing the belly and covering the back. Hence, succeeds a softness, an effeminacy, a seeking for the fireside, a lurking in the bed, and in short, all the characteristics of idleness, for which, in this case, real want of strength furnishes an apology. The tea drinking fills the public-houses, makes the frequenting of it habitual, corrupts boys as soon they are able to move from home, and does little less for the girls, to whom the gossip of the tea-table is no bad preparatory school for the brothel. At the very least, it teaches them idleness.</blockquote><br /><p>Which brings me to the <a href="http://www.databasecolumn.com/2008/01/mapreduce-a-major-step-back.html">attack on MapReduce today</a>, which spectacularly misses the point by attacking a programming technique for not being a database and contains the striking line: <blockquote>Given the experimental evaluations to date, we have serious doubts about how well MapReduce applications can scale. </blockquote><br />(MapReduce is what Google uses to run complex data-manipulation problems on lots of computers in parallel to do things that databases fail at, like building an index for all the webpages it has found, or rendering map tiles for everywhere on earth in Google maps).

  <span class="p-name">Identity Theft is not a crime</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Fraud however, is.<p>Jeremy Clarkson scoffed at the UK Government data leak debacle, and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7174760.stm">published his bank details in The Sun</a>:<blockquote>"All you'll be able to do with them is put money into my account. Not take it out. Honestly, I've never known such a palaver about nothing," he told readers.<br /><br />But he was proved wrong, as the 47-year-old wrote in his Sunday Times column.<br /><br />"I opened my bank statement this morning to find out that someone has set up a direct debit which automatically takes £500 from my account," he said.<br /><br />"The bank cannot find out who did this because of the Data Protection Act and they cannot stop it from happening again.<br /><br />"I was wrong and I have been punished for my mistake."<br /><br />Police were called in to search for the two discs, which contained the entire database of child benefit claimants and apparently got lost in the post in October 2007.<br /><br />They were posted from HM Revenue and Customs offices in Tyne and Wear, but never turned up at their destination - the National Audit Office.<br /><br />The loss, which led to an apology from Prime Minister Gordon Brown, created fears of identity fraud.<br /><br />Clarkson now says of the case: "Contrary to what I said at the time, we must go after the idiots who lost the discs and stick cocktail sticks in their eyes until they beg for mercy." </blockquote><br />I'm amazed that the normally combative Clarkson has accepted this feeble excuse from his bank, when they have just handed out a huge sum of his money to someone else against his wishes, revealing that they are failing in their primary purpose of keeping money safely.<p>That their security process can fail spectacularly in this way, enabling fraudsters to siphon off money, is sadly all too common.<p>What is notable is that the banks have spent enormous sums of money promoting the concept of 'identity theft' through <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KERwnA8VfFM">clever TV adverts</a>, diverting their customers' attention from their security cock-ups, despite the fact that they are liable for the fraudulently dispersed funds. I don't understand why the banks continue to use "mothers maiden name" as default password, and enable debits this way, then hide behind data protection legislation when their error is pointed out. Clarkson should be railing at the idiots at his bank, too.<br /><h3>Update:</h3> Thanks to <a href="http://www.kerrybuckley.com/">Kerry Buckley</a> in the comments for this excellent comedy sketch that sums it up perfectly:<object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CS9ptA3Ya9E&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CS9ptA3Ya9E&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>

  Cameo pointed me at this <a href="http://whatifoundthere.livejournal.com/211232.html">dada album cover meme</a> today:<blockquote><ol><li>The first article title on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Wikipedia Random Articles</a> page is the name of your band.</li><br /><li>The last four words of the very last quotation on the <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3">Random Quotations page</a> is the title of your album.</li><br /><li>The third picture in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/">Flickr's Interesting Photos From The Last 7 Days</a> will be your album cover.</li><br /><li>Use your graphics programme of choice to throw them together, and post the result.</li></ol></blockquote><p>I got the following via <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/65387854@N00/2151477749/">this flickr image</a> (which I hope counts as fair use - <a href="http://chocolateandvodka.com/2008/01/04/a-meme-to-keep-you-happy/">Suw uses CC images instead</a>)<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080104-dcfhu8cphkydsnnucr79hc41nq.jpg" alt="album_meme"/><p>I just found out via Twitter that my colleague from (mumble mumble) years ago, <a href="http://incunabula2.com/">Nikki Barton, has a blog</a>; she's wise - read her.<p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEanimate/SEanimate1951/SE1999Aug11T.GIF" />Rosie asked me "Was there a Solar eclipse in Yorkshire in 1967?" - the answer was No, but I found <a href="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/eclipse.html">this great NASA site</a>, which reminded me of my Astronomy tutor at Cambridge from 1987, who at the time had booked a hotel in Cornwall for the 1999 total eclipse (I hope the clouds lifted for him).

  <span class="p-name">URLs are people too</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  There is an assumption buried in the collective mind of developers that is hard to remove, and it is that people are best represented by email addresses. Go to almost any website to sign-up, and you are prompted for an email address and password. Signing up usually involves digging out the site's reply from your spam folder and clicking on a link to get confirmed, then giving it a password. Sometimes you get to pick a username too, from whatever stock of namespace is left at the site.<p><br /><a href="http://elizabethchurchill.com/professional/pubs/Papers/CHI2007GrossChurchill.pdf">Elizabeth Churchill and Ben Gross looked into this</a> and found out that people find it easier to remember passwords than usernames, because they use the same passwords everywhere, and they end up with multiple different email accounts to handle the problem of having handed them to to all these sites and getting spammed by them.<p><br />Meanwhile, over here in the blog world, we've been using blog URLs to refer to people for years, and social network sites have proliferated URLs that are people. I have several that refer to me, my events, my music, my twitters and my photographs linked from the sidebar here. We even have <a href="http://www.gmpg.org/xfn/and/">XFN's rel="me"</a> to connect them together, and <a href="http://openid.net/what/">OpenID</a> to allow them to be used as logins elsewhere, instead of emails.<p><br />The underlying thing that is wrong with an email address is that it's affordance is backwards - it enables people who have it to send things to you, but there's no reliable way to know that a message is from you. Conversely, URLs have the opposite default affordance- people can go look at them and see what you have said about yourself, and computers can go and visit them and discover other ways to interact with what you have published, or ask you permission for more.<p><br />So, developers, remember that URLs are people too.<p><br />Update: This tension between email-as-identifier and email-as-way-to-be-spammed is what makes <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/01/03/ive-been-kicked-off-of-facebook/">Scoble's attempt to extract 5,000 people's emails from Facebook</a> for his own use less defensible than it appears at first. <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/01/03/FacebookRightScobleWrongSocialNetworkInteroperabilityAndTheOReillySocialGraphFOOCamp.aspx">Dare Obasanjo recognises the tensions</a>, but strangely dismisses the OpenSocial attempt to abstract out this kind of data into a common API.

  <p>I had some hopes for Amazon's e-book device - after all I buy paper books from Bezos via Amazon Prime weekly, I buy <a href="http://www.subterraneanpress.com/">Subterranean Press's splendid editions</a>, and I even end up susbcribing to the <a href="http://www.foliosoc.co.uk/">Folio Society's</a> offers each year.

Kindle requires DRM. <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003/09/media-heresy-drm-destroys-value.html">DRM destroys value</a> - it makes things do less and cost more, and means they will break suddenly without warning when the service inevitably goes bust.</p><p>If you have $400 to spend on a small gadget to read outdoors on, <a href="http://laptopgiving.org/en/index.php">buy yourself an OLPC and give one away to a child elsewhere too</a>.

  <span class="p-name">All bloggers are above average</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://chuqui.typepad.com/chuqui_30/2007/10/total-versus-ac.html">Chuq</a> and <a href="http://www.jaffejuice.com/2007/10/total-versus-ac.html">Joseph</a> are pondering 'active' blogs. Chuq says:<blockquote><p>As of today, my feed readership is between 550 and 600. My Technorati authority is 117, my rank is 54,800ish. All things considered, my blogs are small, very much personal.</p><p>Yet, do the math. 100 MILLION blogs, and mine is the 50,000th largest in the world?</p><p>Or do your own test. create an empty blog, register it with technorati, post a couple of test messages, and do nothing else. Don't advertise it, don't point to it, don't create content. you'll likely find that Technorati will throw it somewhere around 1mm in authority.</p></blockquote><p>He goes on to challenge Technorati's count of 100 million blogs because of this. What is really going on? Well, links to blogs follow a Long Tail distribution. You can debate whether it's a power law or an exponential, but it isn't a gaussian. Here's a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/blogpower.swf">2005 links vs rank log chart</a>, and here's a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/blogpower.swf">2006 one</a> (if Technorati want to run my old script that generates these we could have a 2007 one). Technorati's 'Authority' is the number of inbound links in the last 180 days. So, as Chuq notes, if you have a new blog with no links to it, it is ranked about 4 millionth, tied with every other blog with no inbound links. So yes, everyone is above average - they're all on the 96th percentile.</p><p>But what happens when you start getting links? I have a couple of old blogs that have a few. With 2 links, my rank goes up to 2.6 Millionth; with 3 to 1.9 millionth, with 5 to 1.2 millionth, up to this blog with 141 inbound links ranked at 44,734. This is a very easy hill to climb in percentage terms, though clearly getting into the top 100 is still relatively hard.</p><p>So what of Chuq's contention that the other 96 million blogs with no links are "abandoned, stillborn, or some kind of spam blog" ? A lot of blogs are made for specific events, and don't need further posts adding (and so may not have been linked to in the last 180 days), and a lot have a low posting rate, sure. But, as <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2003/11.html#When:8:45:40PM">Dave Winer once said</a>, by that measure every book and magazine article is abandoned. Not all blogs are interested in links - many are personal journals or for a small group of friends to read, and achieving those goals well.</p><p>So Chuq's accusations of "playing fast and loose wiht the numbers" are really his misunderstandings of Long Tail distributions. In the Blogosphere, like Lake Woebegon, everyone really is above average.</p>

And then I can analyze afterwards and realize that's what it was. Funny enough, the beauty in industry, which is probably killing us, but actually nevertheless is beautifully like Hades, is one reason why you start to feel the beauty in the godawful condition of the red horizon and the geysers of filth going into the air. I used to go to art school in West Hartlepool College up in the north of England, which is almost right alongside the Durham steel mills and Imperial Chemical Industries, and the air would smell like toast. Toast is quite nice, but when you realize it's steel, and it's probably particles, it's not very good. But I'm still here. So, you draw back on that. And to walk across that footbridge at night, you'd be walking fundamentally above, on an elevated walk on the steel mill. So you'd be crossing through, sometimes, the smoke and dirt and crap, and you're looking down into the fire. So, things like that are remembered.</blockquote><br clear="all" /><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mysteryme/225149888/">See this one too</a>

  <span class="p-name">Storytelling and performance</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/opinion/06mathias.html?_r=1&ex=1349409600&en=465bad38b9d8bd6c&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin">Alice Mathias in the NYT</a> points out that public profiles are a kind of performance:<blockquote><p>Facebook did not become popular because it was a functional tool — after all, most college students live in close quarters with the majority of their Facebook friends and have no need for social networking. Instead, we log into the Web site because it’s entertaining to watch a constantly evolving narrative starring the other people in the library.</p><p>I’ve always thought of Facebook as online community theater. In costumes we customize in a backstage makeup room — the Edit Profile page, where we can add a few Favorite Books or touch up our About Me section — we deliver our lines on the very public stage of friends’ walls or photo albums. And because every time we join a network, post a link or make another friend it’s immediately made visible to others via the News Feed, every Facebook act is a soliloquy to our anonymous audience.</p><p>It’s all comedy: making one another laugh matters more than providing useful updates about ourselves, which is why entirely phony profiles were all the rage before the grown-ups signed in. One friend announced her status as In a Relationship with Chinese Food, whose profile picture was a carry-out box and whose personal information personified the cuisine of China.</p></blockquote><p>This is of course what <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/HICSS2006.pdf">danah has been saying for years:</a><blockquote><p>While some early adopters viewed Friendster as a serious tool for networking, others were more interested in creating non-biographical characters for playful purposes. Referred to as Fakesters, these Profiles represented everything from famous people (e.g., Angelina Jolie) and fictional characters (Homer Simpson) to food (Lucky Charms), concepts (Pure Evil), and affiliations (Brown University). Some Fakesters were created to connect people with common affiliations, geography, or interests. The most active and visible Fakesters, however, were primarily crafted for play. [...]</p><p>Fakesters had a significant impact on the cultural context of Friendster. In their resistance, their primary goal was to remind users that, “none of this is real.” They saw purportedly serious Profiles as fantastical representations of self, while the Testimonials and popularity aspect of the Friend network signified the eternal struggle to make up for being alienated in high school. Through play, Fakesters escaped the awkward issues around approving Friends and dealing with collapsed contexts, mocking the popularity contest. Their play motivated other participants to engage in creative performance, but at the same time, their gaming created a schism in the network resulting in a separation between playful participants and serious networkers.</p></blockquote> Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.quernstone.com/archives/2007/10/finally-a-reaso.html">Jonathan Sanderson is explaining the art of video storytelling, and how to stop short of lèse majesté</a>:<blockquote><p>I want to write about fakery in television, because there's something odd going on. None of these 'scandals', from naming Socks the cat to having someone stand in for competition winners when the phone line goes dead in the full glare of live transmission, is particularly shocking to anyone who's made videos. Not worked in broadcast, note -- made videos. When I get a bunch of 14 year-olds to make their first short film, they'll frequently assume they can fake stuff, cheat, and generally bend the resulting video to their will.</p><p>Now, all it takes is for me to stare at them for a few moments. The light will go off in their heads and they'll say 'Oh, right. OK, yes. Fine. We'll do it for real.' But the natural human affiliation with cheating is sufficiently powerful, it's often the first assumption.</p><p>Later in the day, when the same group is putting together their sequence, they'll find me and say 'If we change the order like this, the film makes more sense. But... that's faking, isn't it?'</p><p>...which is, of course, the crux of the matter, because all video is faked to some extent or other. Everything you do up to the point where you start editing is just collecting raw material -- your film is made, crafted, shaped, in the edit suite, not in front of the camera.</p><p>It has to be this way, because real life plays out excruciatingly slowly. The responsibility and skill in making films, then, lies in telling stories more quickly, and more engagingly, than real time. Which requires that you leave bits out, which in turn requires judgement about which parts are important.</p><p>Telling stories honestly is an aspiration, but not a requirement -- the temptation to cheat and edit the material in order to tell an even better story even more quickly is always there. If the story's better, and more people watch, that's a success, right? If teenagers hacking away in iMovie in a school lab face these sorts of dilemmas and compromises, you can imagine the discussions that happen in chic Avid suites in Soho.</p></blockquote><p>We all live in the minds of others through telling them stories about ourselves, but we also live in our own minds that way too - the <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2007/06/08">research on memory</a> shows how we readily confabulate extra detail to flesh out a story, and that every time we remember somethign we reify it further, combining it with new experiences both real and confabulated, so that the tale grows in the telling.</p><p>As <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/KnowledgeTree.pdf">danah notes</a>, the persistence, searchability and replicablity of these digital environments belie our self-constructed memories with <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005/12/of-bloggercon-and-podcasting.html">awkwardly concrete virtual histories</a>. <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/massively_multiplayer_online_t.html">Massively Multiplayer Online Truth</a> is an interesting game, and one where we are still working out the rules.</p>

  <span class="p-name">iPod progress</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I got an new iPod nano for my birthday yesterday. I considered the iPhone and iPod Touch, but their poor keyboard won't replace my Sidekick, and they omitted the most important features.<br />Specifically, iPhone lacks instant messaging, and both iPhone and iPod touch have Wifi, yet unaccountably don't support iTunes song sharing.</p><p>A bit of context here — back when we were pitching Wifi and Zeroconf to Steve Jobs at Apple, the killer demo was the iTunes + QuickTime sharing of music and videos — Macs in the same room finding each other and making their music libraries and videos mutually available, <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/24.82.html#subj10">whether you have a router or not</a>. The underlying protocol here is called <a href="http://www.opendaap.org/">DAAP</a>, which is just some conventions for using HTTP 1.1 to play remotely and update the song list.</p><p>However, the edition of iTunes this went out in was unfortunately the same one that added the iTunes Store. From our developer point of view, the fact that there were 4 separate open source interoperating implementations of DAAP within a week was a big burst of validation for our efforts, but this caused huge confusion among the Record Labels that Jobs had invested so much time in schmoozing to set the store up. Eventually, after too many arguments with Label execs where he tried to explain "but the songs bought from iTunes Store won't be playable remotely, just the CD-ripped ones", he insisted the protocol be changed, which it was, several times.</p><p>The social sharing of music via iTunes is still a new and lovely feature of offices, campuses and coffee shops everywhere. But the iPhone users are left out in the cold. They can't see iTunes libraries, they can't share their own songs. Watching the launch of the "buy the song playing in Starbucks" feature, my immediate thought was "Steve, do you want to change the world, or do you just want to sell sugared coffee to kids?"</p><p>That said, I am a big fan of the 206 dpi screen on the new iPod nano. I did the maths, and that implies a full HD screen (1920x1200 with room for a controller bar) that is about 9.5 inches by 6 inches - sounds like a nice new Apple subnotebook for MacWorld January. Three and a half years ago,<a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2004/01/media-heresy-compression-is-becoming.html"> I pointed out the very rapid growth of storage per buck</a>. I now have an iPod that is half the price, a tenth the weight and volume, and that plays video as predicted.</p>

  A few days back, <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/09/06/confused_by_fac.html">danah asked</a>:<blockquote><p>I am utterly confused by the ways in which the tech industry fetishizes Facebook. There's no doubt that Facebook's F8 launch was *brilliant*. Offering APIs and the possibility of monetization is a Web 2.0 developer's wet dream. (Never mind that I don't know of anyone really making money off of Facebook aside from the Poker App guy.) But what I don't understand is why so much of the tech crowd who lament Walled Gardens worship Facebook. What am I missing here? Why is the tech crowd so entranced with Facebook?</p></blockquote>This made me think of <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005/12/key-indicator-for-bubble.html">my sure-fire bubble indicator</a>:<blockquote><p>When expensively educated, fashionable young graduates start showing up in your field, you're in a bubble.</p><p>[...}The trouble with this indicator is that if you aren't looking for it it seem like the natural order of things - of course having personable young things hanging on your every word is to be expected - finally you're getting the recognition you deserve!</p><p>In practice, however, the finely-tuned herd instincts that get selected for in the Ivy League or the posher UK universities make them flock to the latest bubble</p></blockquote><p>By this measure, we are well into a bubble in the Valley, (Google being the top company of choice for MBA's is one example), but Facebook has a perfect conjunction here - growing out of Harvard and the Ivy League, it started out with the very crowd of high-achieving conformists that danah called <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/06/24/viewing_america.html">hegemonic teens</a>, who make up my leading indicator, so when they connected with the tech crowd the mentos hit the coke.</p>

  <span class="p-name">Journalists slumming online</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I've realised why I got quote so cross with Andrew Keen and the way he portrays the net as 'corrupting'. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/books/review/Kennedy-t.html&OQ=_rQ3D2Q26orefQ3Dslogin&OP=779f0ad3Q2FXnjdXbzvQ24lzz!FXFiiAXiQ5BXiFXdzzfQ24XljsajnXMjHHjbuQ26!Q2Ag!Q27Q60">Pagan Kennedy's essay on MySpace</a> reminded me, and <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2007/08/this_is_not_a_brothel/">Tom's passionate defence of his blog against PR slummers</a> who want to use him as a mouthpiece confirmed this thought. There is a temptation online, and that is to go slumming - to pretend that you can abuse people's trust and emotions without fear of personal consequences, that people online are somehow not real and so you can toy with them and remain above it. A while back at Making Light, <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/007012.html#103134">Lucy Kemnitzer explained this well:</a><br /><blockquote><p>Slumming isn't going to a seedy place. Slumming is taking your superior attitude and your certainty that the world is your Disneyland in with you. It's looking at the people who work there as performing monkeys putting on a show for you. It's being cushioned by your privilege. It's thinking that if the place is raided, surely you will be passed over because you're not one of those people. It's running a narration in your head where you are the normal observer, and those guys are the freaks.</p><p>You can do it almost everywhere. I've seen people do it on an ordinary residential street in a city, going into a corner restaurant or working man's bar as if it were the Exotic And Dangerous Gangsta Exhibit at a Los Vegas theme hotel. I've seen people do it at a flea market in an ordinary rural town. Or at the weekly get-together of a community, where they danced and sang and gave each other presents (a pow-wow). I saw people doing it at my college, thanks to a former Governor and President calling it a cross between a hippie pad and a bordello.</p><p>Here's a clue about how not to go slumming when you enter a place: shed your privilege and your pretensions to superiority. If they play music that isn't to your taste, maybe it's because they hear something in it that you don't, so listen. If they're presenting an image you find disturbing, maybe you're not looking at it right. If you can't get out of your own skull while you're there, maybe you belong somewhere else.</p></blockquote><p>When Keen (p76) cites Michael Hiltzik and Lee Siegel (both journalists who got caught in sock-puppetry online - posting hagiographic comments about themselves through pseudonyms), it is not their perfidy he condemns, but the Internet as enabler. In fact, it is their slumming and condescension that is the problem - their longing for freedom from consequences of their actions that led them astray. Keen himself is a knowing troll, trying to be the Simon Cowell of Web 2.0, and behaving like a pantomime villain to get web conferences to boo him. The ultimate example of this kind of slumming was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-skube19aug19,0,3547019.story">Michael Skube's polemic against blogs</a>, profoundly <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oew-rosen22aug22,0,4771551.story">rebutted by Jay Rosen</a>. Pagan Kennedy's tone is dancing around the edges of slumming - she starts out with "OMG drunk teenagers", but the article comes to realise that people online are human too, and makes fun of her own original attitudes.</p><br /><a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/007012.html#103155">abi sums it up:</a><blockquote>The girls in question would not have been slumming if they had been going to drink the drinks, chat to the patrons, or see the dancers. They weren't. They were going to watch themselves drink the drinks, chat to the patrons, and see the dancers. It's like Kundera's definition of kitsch - the last layer of self-observation determines the definition.</blockquote>

  <span class="p-name">Will botnets compete with Amazon S3?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Reading about <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/08/storm_worm_dwarfs_worlds_top_s_1.html">the Storm Worm's botnet being bigger than supercomputers</a> I was reminded of a prediction I've been making for a while. Spamming and phishing and other bad behaviour relies on overwhelming miniscule conversion rates through huge volume, so it has to free-ride on others' resources to actually make money. However, large distributed computing is being commoditised, by Amazon's S3 and E3C and others. At some point the botnets will realise that they can make more money by competing with Amazon or Akamai to store data in their stochastic cloud of compromised computers. A variant of <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">memcached</a> with a redundant hashing algorithm, or maybe an adaptation of <a href="http://freenetproject.org/">Freenet</a> would be obvious places to start; for all I know this already exists.

  <span class="p-name">Best advice on scandals ever from TNH</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  In the <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/009334.html">Making Light thread</a> on the SFWA's debacle where <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/30/science-fiction-writ-1.html">Andrew Burt used a bot searching for 'Asimov' to issue DMCA takedown notices willy-nilly</a>, sideswiping Cory, Teresa Nielsen-Hayden gave the clearest, most compact <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/009334.html#210292">advice on handling net PR disasters</a> ever:<blockquote><ol><li> Get out there and say something, fast.</li><li>Acknowledge that there have been screwups. Avoid passive constructions. </li><li> Explain what you're doing to help fix the problem. Be telling the truth when you do it. </li><li> Give up all hope of sneaking anything past your listeners. You've screwed up, the internet is watching, and behind each and every one of those pairs of eyes is a person who knows how to Google. </li><li>Corporate-speak will do you more harm than good. Instead, speak frankly about what's going on. React like a human being. Talk like one, too.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Also,<a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/009334.html#210156"> James D.

  <p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/23/ok-ok-all-of-you-even-youtube-invented-video-overlay-ads-first/">Mike Arrington has been stirring it about YouTube's new in-frame ads</a> but this idea is something that dates back years, way back to the late 80s. In 1989 my colleagues Max Whitby, Nikki Barton and Chris Prior made a documentary with Douglas Adams called "Hyperland" looking at hypertext and the interlinked video future. Here's a snip where they explain 'micons':</p><br /><object width="425" height="350"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PxtxRJo37rI"> </param> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PxtxRJo37rI" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"> </embed> </object><br /><p>What they went through back then to make all those overlaid animated video loops doesn't bear thinking about.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>The term <a href="http://www.bacn2.com/">bacn</a> for <blockquote><p>email you receive that isn’t spam… And isn’t personal mail. It’s the middle class of email. It’s notifications of a new post to your Facebook wall or a new follower on Twitter. It’s the Google alert for your name and the newsletter from your favorite company.</p></blockquote> is a handy word for a new phenomenon, but it looks like it should be an acronym. Boring Automated Computer Notifications, perhaps?</p><p>Also, we need another word for the kind of bacn that doens't tell you the notificiation, but is just a way to get you to click on a link and generate a pageview for someone like Evite or Facebook. I suggest we call these 'mushrooms', as they keep you in the dark and feed you dirt. Also, because that gives me an excuse to link to Andrew's <a href="http://funnystories.blogspot.com/2005/05/bacon-bacon-bacon-movie.html">Bacon movie</a> again.</p>

  <span class="p-name">Stardust - best movie of the year</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Before I go into details, let me say that you should go and see <a href="http://www.google.com/movies/reviews?cid=b37c799de1219af7&fq=stardust&sa=X&oi=showtimes&ct=reviews&cd=1">Stardust</a> tomorrow. Take friends and loved ones; you'll thank me for it later. <p>We watched <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2007/08/andrews-film-bee-aware-public-screening.html">Edward Scissorhands in San Jose's St James Park</a> on Friday night, which has a magic realism of it's own, what with the light rail passing either side of the park, the planes and nightclub searchlights in the sky, and the audience mixing the homeless who sleep in the park with a throng of our friends picnicking. I called <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005/08/charlie-and-chocolate-factory-and.html">Edward Scissorhands</a> a geek parable before, but its screenwriter Caroline Thompson describes it as a fable - a story you know isn't true but care about anyway. It takes a fantastic character and brings him into the mundane world to try to cope. <p><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0486655/">Stardust</a> is in some ways the opposite of this - Tristan escapes from his conforming world to a fantastic one, a world of danger that tests him. That he can't resist returning to show himself off is a pivotal moment in the plot; the world of Stronghold has a very sharply drawn medieval conflict over succession, that echoes and parodies many we have seen. Tristan's lovestruck quest is pithily skewered by Yvaine, the star who is its object. It is a picaresque story, but Vaughn brings some of the English subcultural texture from <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0208092/">Snatch</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0375912/">Layer Cake</a> to it too, with archetypically English small time crooks and fences represented.<p>What is different from those works, and which owes more to <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/">Gaiman</a> than Vaughn, is the underlying morality of the story. I have been strongly impressed by this current within British fantasy work recently - the revived <a href="http://paulcornell.blogspot.com/2007/07/stardust-and-faf.html">Doctor Who</a> is exemplary this way, as is the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dangerous-Book-Boys-Conn-Iggulden/dp/0007232748">Dangerous Book for Boys</a>, and even <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/books/review/Hitchens-t.html?_r=3&adxnnl=1&ampladxnnlx=1186840914-OUgjhcnZejswml3KgknPNg&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin">Christopher Hitchens</a> can see it in Harry Potter.<p>In each case there is an acknowledgment that there is evil in the world, but a consistent message that it is best fought through love, through integrity and through striving to transcend our recognised flaws. Though secular in tone and style they echo for me the sublimated Anglicanism of Lewis and Tolkein; doing the right thing for the sake of this world, not the next.

  <p>The other day I was joking about some abstruse aspect of XML and I said "I happen to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim%20Bray" rel="tag">Tim Bray</a> right here", in reference, of course, to Woody Allen's devastating cinema queue put-down in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0075686/">Annie Hall</a>.

I can find copious examples of Tim Bray's or Marshall McLuhan's work, searching them for the citation I need, I can talk to Tim, or see how the <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2007/08/as-dr-johnson-said.html">authors</a> of books I like feel about their movie adaptations.</p><p>It seemed as if the joke was on me, as the chap I was talking to had never seen Annie Hall.

  <span class="p-name">Microformats in Blogger - hAtom support</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Those of you who read my blog directly, rather than via a feed-reader, will notice that it is looking styled again, for the first time since <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2007/04/css-naked-day.html">CSS Naked Day in April</a>.</p><p> I made an initial conversion to <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom" rel="tag">hAtom</a> by hand in the meantime, but a few weeks back <a href="http://blog.cierniak.org/" rel="co-worker colleague met">Michał Cierniak</a> and I checked in a change to the underlying Blogger templates to make hAtom the default, which the Blogger team graciously accepted. This should enable much simpler client-side parsing of the blog pages. One thing we had to do to enable this was to add a new datatype to output a date in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">the W3C's ISO-8601 profile</a>, as expected by hAtom. If you look in the templates now, you'll see markup like this:</p><blockquote><code>&lt;abbr class='published' expr:title='data:post.timestampISO8601'&gt; &lt;data:post.timestamp/&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;</code></blockquote><p>If you want to make your own hAtom friendly templates, you can use the <code>data:post.timestampISO8601</code> appropriately in the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/datetime-design-pattern">date-time design pattern</a>; the <code>data:post.timestamp</code> will reflect your personal formatting preferences as before.</p>

  <span class="p-name">End Homographophobia now</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>There is a dangerous prejudice afoot in the technical world - Homographophobia. Those who suffer from it call for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=namespaces%20Tower%20of%20Babel">segregation</a>, to avoid the miscegenation of meaning - they want to ensure that their <a href="http://www.sundials.org/about/humpty.htm">Humpty-Dumpty definitions</a> are not <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/namespaces">polluted by sharing</a> with <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/open_namespaces_for_tags.html#comment-190997">others</a>.

  <span class="p-name">Social networks - what's the Object-ive?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>One way of thinking about social networks is through "social objects" - the cultural touchstones and shared ideas that we use to bridge our Dunbar-constrained networks to broader communities. We all do this - use some shared object as a point of conversational reference. Here in the US it tends to be sports teams activities; in the UK there's always the weather to fall back on. (This fails in California because it's too predictable - when I came here in 1998 it took me a while to realise that saying "beautiful day again" was like saying "I see gravity's still working" to Californians). </p><p>Talking about social objects is nothing new - <a href="http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why_some_social.html">Jyri discussed them at length back in 2005</a>, and danah <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/FriendsterMySpaceEssay.html">dissected Friendster's suicide in 2006</a> when they killed off the Fakesters (user profiles that represented social objects like "Jack Daniels" and "Burning Man").</p><p>Where I find the 'Dunbar number' idea falls down is that social network connections, like so many other human-made things, are power-law distributed. The small number of highly-connected entities that fulfil the role of social objects are sometimes people. If you think about celebrities, they clearly fit- being able to discuss Brad and Jen and Angelina's latest shenanigans binds you in, and shows like American Idol are designed to draw on this need, giving the Faustian bargain of fame in exchange for objectification.</p><p>Different social network services can be distinguished through the different kinds of object that lead to their success. Friendster's expulsion of Fakesters, and later attempts to use TV characters is one example; MySpace's embrace of independent bands and FaceBook's initial use of Universities as touchstones help <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html">explain their divergence.</a> LinkedIn has Companies as their touchstone, Orkut has it's communities, which are often used as badges for the users to express their identity. Suicide Girls is a blog network focused around models-as-objects, last.fm uses songs and bands, Flickr uses photos, Dopplr uses places.</p><p>Looked at in this way, <a href="http://james.hotornot.com/2007/07/reinventing-hotornot-part-ii.html">James Hong's attempt</a> to change the core objects of HotOrNot from pictures of strangers to pictoral self-tags he calls "Stylepix" seems an interesting experiment.</p><p>Making sense of the different object graphs and how they interact with the social graphs in these overlapping sites will keep lots more researchers busy, I'm sure.</p>

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Editing shows respect. Steve Gillmor has put up his new video podcast <a href="http://gesturelab.com/?p=87">Bad Sinatra</a> which is him unedited wandering around and chatting to people. Now, I like Steve, and enjoy having rambling conversations with him about things, but I don't think it works as video. With video, as with audio, editing shows respect for your audience. To do a truly live or as-live show, like the splendid <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/">In Our Time</a>, you need to plan it out in advance and choreograph it. Otherwise, you need to edit. Carefully.</p><p> If you want to hear a perfectly edited podcast, listen to <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/">Radiolab</a>. I spend 90 minutes a day cycling and listening to my iPod, which is exactly the use case for podcasting I <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005/04/bbc-goes-mp3.html">explained to the BBC</a> a few years back. Now that shows of this quality are there to be downloaded regularly, my tolerance for self-indulgent rambling podcasts like <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/audio/manifesto.mp3">bad voicemail messages</a> is way down.</p><p> I made this point way back at the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005/12/of-bloggercon-and-podcasting.html">dawn of podcasting</a> , when Chris Lydon's well-edited interviews inspired us to download them to our iPods. In the online world we are each others' media, as we mediate what is worth reading for each other through our blogs and <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/03474483732051894197" rel="me">link streams</a>. This too, is a form of editing, and doing it shows respect for each other. Steve, tighten it up into something worth watching. My children <a href="http://funnystories.blogspot.com/2007/02/stop-motion-with-people.html">know how to do it</a>.</p>

  <span class="p-name">Open versus Closed - code and networks</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I read two things this morning in praise of closed systems and fêting their future dominance, both by people who should know better. Bob Cringely praises Adobe's Flash, and predicts that AIR will take over the world because Flash can be made to run on cellphones. Clearly, this is wishful thinking on Adobe's part. There is a standard for creating user interfaces that has many orders of magnitude more developers than Flash, is installed on every computer and nearly every cellphone already, and is powerful enough that even Steve Jobs didn't dare to leave it off the iPhone, and that's HTML.<p></p> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070629_002360.html">Cringely says</a>:<blockquote><p>Once you own the interface to every mobile device you can make those devices talk more easily to your networked applications than possibly to those from Apple, Microsoft, or Sun. As we move toward a fully mobile Internet, compliance with mobile APIs will be more important than what operating system is running on the server, which is why I believe Adobe is putting so much effort behind AIR and Flex.</p></blockquote></p><p>"Owning" interfaces is not something that you can do when there is an existing interface that is simple, powerful and deployed on every device imaginable already. That would be HTTP - Cringely's piece starts by saying how HTML has made it beyond ubiquity to invisibility, but HTTP is so invisible he doesn't even notice that it's there (let alone TCP or UDP).</p><p>Marc Andreesson also has a good underlying point about the <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/now-playing-sil.html">Valley's short attention span</a> with regard to technologies, but he too ends up praising a closed application model, in this case Facebook's. They provide access to their users under sufferance, and clearly can't provide access to users of otehr social networking sites. For Marc to back a closed system like this when he has built his career on open ones is odd to me. <a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/06/facebook-is-the-new-aol">Kottke puts this well:</a><blockquote><p>As it happens, we already have a platform on which anyone can communicate and collaborate with anyone else, individuals and companies can develop applications which can interoperate with one another through open and freely available tools, protocols, and interfaces. It's called the internet and it's more compelling than AOL was in 1994 and Facebook in 2007. Eventually, someone will come along and turn Facebook inside-out, so that instead of custom applications running on a platform in a walled garden, applications run on the internet, out in the open, and people can tie their social network into it if they want, with privacy controls, access levels, and alter-egos galore.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/06/17/itsTimeToOpenUpNetworkingA.html">Dave Winer agrees</a> it is time to do this:</p><blockquote><p>Eventually, soon I think, we'll see an explosive unbundling of the services that make up social networks. What was centralized in the form of Facebook, Linked-in, even YouTube, is going to blow up and reconstitute itself.</p></blockquote><p>The thing is , pace Andreesson, we have been working on building a consensus to express these connections in an open way for a few years now. We already have a way to express social networks and personal information online. We have <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a> for expressing contact information and authorship, and we have <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN</a> to express social connection. <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, Dave's <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html">experimental platform</a>, already <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/05/07/twitter-adds-support-for-hatom-hcard-and-xfn/">supports this</a>. Lets continue to spread it further.</p>

  <span class="p-name">Jobs WWDC keynote in chapters</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I finished watching the WWDC Macworld Keynote from last week - here's my <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7cAS_dEul22MlEtRFhabkc0a2c/wwdc2007.mov">chapter-list version of the stream</a> so you can skip through it to the bits you find interesting:<br /><object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B" width="640" height="368" codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab" ><param name="src" value="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7cAS_dEul22MlEtRFhabkc0a2c/wwdc2007.mov"><param name="autoplay" value="false"><param name="controller" value="true"><embed src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7cAS_dEul22MlEtRFhabkc0a2c/wwdc2007.mov" width="640" height="368" autoplay="false" controller="true" pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"></embed></object><br /><p>My overall reaction similar to <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2007/06/even-steve-jobs-cant-ignore-web.html">what I said based on textual reports</a>. Jobs saying that web-based applications are as good as native ones on the iPhone is a big change for him, and a sign that development really has changed. What was clearly flawed in the iPhone directory app demo was the need to write all the integration links into the site - how about Safari/iPhone natively understanding <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a> and integrating it with apps, like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4106">Operator</a> does in Firefox?</p><p>Stacks seems not to really solve the too many documents problem well - see <a href="http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2007/06/bumptop_and_pil.html">Tim Oren's discussion of literalism and magic</a> (Tim worked on 'Piles', the less euphoniously named version of this idea at Apple, long ago).</p><p>The dynamic DNS support integrated in 'Back to my Mac' is great idea for those not yet committed to keeping their documents in the cloud. The tension between Jobs advocating a new OS with 300 features, versus a thin client on the iPhone to the same developers was pretty clear.</p><p>Jobs saying that Safari for Windows has built-in support for both Google and Yahoo Search was not something I saw anyone pick up on.</p><p>Oh, and one more thing... the new iChat features look great, but why is there still no demo or even mention of iChat on iPhone? The main thing I use my sidekick for is AIM chatting, and if iPhone can't do that and forces chat through the procrustean constraints of SMS it's a huge missed opportunity.</p>

  <span class="p-name">Keening for Culture</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Andrew Keen turned up at Google today to plug his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0385520808%26tag=epeusepigone-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0385520808%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">The Cult of the Amateur: How today's Internet is killing our culture</a>. I was too late to get a copy of the book, so reviewing that will have to wait until Amazon delivers me one later this week. Instead, I listened closely and read some of his soi-disant polemics on <a href="http://andrewkeen.typepad.com">his blog</a>.</p><p>Like <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/05/the_shrinking_w.php">Nick Carr</a>, and before him <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003/04/googlewash-hogwash.html">Andrew Orlowski</a> and <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/06/ipod-friendly-versions-of-dvoraks.html">John Dvorak</a>, Keen is a professional troll. He has realised that combining overblown rhetorical attacks on the internet with a smattering of erudite sounding quotation gets him both newspaper commissions and a lot of links from bloggers, and he is making the most of it. Listening to his arguments, I had the feeling that he was clutching at so many straws so he had enough to build his straw man.</p><p>Among the things he said were that he's nostalgic for big media, that the web is not a viable economy for artists, and we need middlemen. Talent is scarce - the value is finding talent. Web 2.0 flattened media lends itself to corruption - media without official gatekeepers is untrustworthy. Youtube is becoming one long commercial break, where the 'best content is sponsored', that most of his evidence is anecdotal, people aren't as smart or as media literate as we'd like them to be and that online anonymity is corrupting (yet he plays along with the <a href="http://xrl.us/wun2">wholly fictitious Strumpette</a>).</p><p>Andrew Keen's real sleight of hand is that he evokes the best of newspapers and contrasts that with the mass of the web. He says that most musicians won't make money from the web, ignoring that hardly any make money from the label system he defends. Like Carr, his worldview is wholly coloured by survivorship bias.</p><p>Now, I recognise a lot of this - being an Englishman in America makes it very tempting to play the Cultural Erudition card - having recently watched the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B000NIVJFO%26tag=epeusepigone-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B000NIVJFO%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">The History Boys</a>, he reminded me of Irwin, the master keen to use gobbets of quotations to support an arbitrarily contrarian premise. This kind of Oxbridge cleverness for its own sake is part of the Guardian/BBC Platonist culture that sees its role to lead the uneducated masses to better themselves, while sneering at their plebian interests. Keen continually calls Google "Orwellian", while ignoring the emotional core of 1984, which is the tension between Winston's day job at the (BBC-derived) Ministry of Information, controlling the party line, and his private diary, written "to the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different for one another and do not live alone". <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1890951293%26tag=epeusepigone-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1890951293%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Michael Warner's</a> essay "Styles of Intellectual Publics" expresses this yearning well, and Keen's denial of it to those outside the clerisy of the professional media is a betrayal of the enlightenment principles he professes.</p><p>So what did I like? I liked that he said the web was a mirror of ourselves, but I see him as a Caliban cursing his reflection, as I said <a href="http://nonzero.blogspot.com/2002_05_01_nonzero_archive.html#85083124">five years ago</a>:<blockquote><p>The web we see is a reflection of ourselves individually as well as collectively.</p><p> With 2 billion pages and counting, we can never see it all, and when we venture outside the well trodden paths of the personal web we know, we are more likely to make mistakes in our maps, and come back with 'here be dragons' written across entire continents and tales of men with no heads.</p><p>I think this effect, rather than malice or wilful misrepresentation is what is behind such things as journalists' clueless articles on weblogs or congressman fulminating against the net consisting mostly of porn and piracy.</p></blockquote></p><p>I also liked his call for media literacy, though his assumption that internet users are children who don't have it was more de haut en bas posturing. <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html">Douglas Adams</a> put paid to this back in 1999:<blockquote>Of course you can’t ‘trust’ what people tell you on the web anymore than you can ‘trust’ what people tell you on megaphones, postcards or in restaurants. Working out the social politics of who you can trust and why is, quite literally, what a very large part of our brain has evolved to do. For some batty reason we turn off this natural scepticism when we see things in any medium which require a lot of work or resources to work in, or in which we can’t easily answer back – like newspapers, television or granite. Hence ‘carved in stone.’ What should concern us is not that we can’t take what we read on the internet on trust – of course you can’t, it’s just people talking – but that we ever got into the dangerous habit of believing what we read in the newspapers or saw on the TV – a mistake that no one who has met an actual journalist would ever make. One of the most important things you learn from the internet is that there is no ‘them’ out there. It’s just an awful lot of ‘us’.</blockquote><p>Update: <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003784.shtml">Larry Lessig points out many of the inaccuracies of the book</a>:</p><blockquote><p>And then it hit me: Keen is our generation’s greatest self-parodist. His book is not a criticism of the Internet. Like the article in Nature comparing Wikipedia and Britannica, the real argument of Keen’s book is that traditional media and publishing is just as bad as the worst of the Internet. Here’s a book — Keen’s — that has passed through all the rigor of modern American publishing, yet which is perhaps as reliable as your average blog post: No doubt interesting, sometimes well written, lots of times ridiculously over the top — but also riddled with errors. Keen’s obvious point is to show those with a blind faith in the traditional system that it can be just as bad as the worst of the Internet. Indeed, one might say even worse, since the Internet doesn’t primp itself with the pretense that its words are promised to be true.</p></blockquote><p>Larry has <a href="http://wiki.lessig.org/index.php?title=TheKeenReader">a wiki page</a> for further corrections</p>

  <span class="p-name">Unceremonial writing</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I was listening to <a href="http://craphound.com/podcast.php">Cory's podcast</a> while cycling home, and while <a href="http://craphound.com/?p=1826">talking about writing</a>, he said something that resonated strongly with me. He said that the danger with writing is that you make it ceremonial, that you have to have a cigarette, or a cup of tea, or the right music playing before you write, and that it is easy to keep accumulating ceremony, until you don't get to the writing part.<br />That struck home, because I stripped the styling from my blog 2 months ago, and said to myself that I'd convert it to a new template with hAtom support and revamped CSS before I posted again. I had put a ceremony in the way of writing here, so I'm going to start writing again, and maybe get around to titivating the markup later. I've been reading and listening and talking a lot over the last two months, just not writing it down here, so I'm going to start doing so again.<br /><br />Cory dropped by at Google a couple of weeks back, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgXwmXpaH2Q">gave a very thoughtful talk on the future of copyrights and politics</a>.<br /><br />Also, his new novel "Little Brother" is a splendid blend of polemic, practical advice on information security and a rollicking tale with characters you can believe in, where he takes his "science fiction is imagining the present" idea to heart and gives a series of recipes for culture clashing. Cory has made writing habitual and frequent. I'll try to do so too.

  <p>Kathy Sierra has cancelled her appearance at eTech <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html">because of death threats she has received online</a>. I am shocked to see this happen, and I am particularly shocked because <a href="http://gonzoengaged.blogspot.com/">some of the people who brought me to blogging in the first place</a> are connected. I have seen a rise in mysogynistic nastiness recently, from the casual asides on lonelygirl15's youtube comments to attack blogs like Violent Acres, but this is way beyond that, and we need to help track down those making the threats.</p><p>The history I know is that Chris Locke and Jeneane Sessum began commenting on some of Tara Hunt's posts, <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2007/02/04/more-on-higher-purpose/">particularly this one</a>, and when the conversation got heated, and 'mean kids' were discussed, Chris (and some others) set up <a href="http://technorati.com/blog/meankids.org">meankids.org</a> as a place to comment without being deleted. It became a place to post ad hominem rants.</p><p>In <a href="http://listics.com/20070320975">a post there attacking Jay Rosen's Assignment Zero</a>, Frank Paynter pointed to the <a href="http://technorati.com/blogs/unclebobism.wordpress.com">unclebobism.wordpress.com</a> blog that Kathy mentioned specifically as making threats. <a href="http://chatrat.blogspot.com/">Paul Ritchie</a> mentions specifically <a href="http://chatrat.blogspot.com/2007/03/boy-moves-again.html">being invited</a> to unclebobism as the <a href="http://chatrat.blogspot.com/2007/03/some-people-are-just-born-to-whinge.html">successor to meankids</a>, then <a href="http://chatrat.blogspot.com/2007/03/wow-capybaras-are-rawrsome.html">posts links</a> to his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kathy_Sierra&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=117915314">vandalism of Kathy's Wikipedia entry</a>. (Some links are to Technorati caches of deleted posts).</p><p>Thats what I have found out, hopefully those who know more will talk about it too.</p><p>When I am at conferences like eTech, I always pay extra attention to the female speakers, because I know how much extra work they have had to do to get up there in this field. I can't believe it has come to this.</p><p>Update: <a href="http://www.rageboy.com/2007/03/re-kathy-sierras-allegations.html">Chris</a> and <a href="http://listics.com/20070326984">Frank</a> have posted, distancing themselves from the comments. However, if "You Own Your Own Words", how about identifying the 'owners' of the threats and nasty posts on the blogs they administered?<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/death threats" rel="tag">death threats</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Kathy Sierra" rel="tag">Kathy Sierra</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Social network narcissism</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I just read <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/03/17/fame_narcissism.html">a very thought-provoking post on narcissism</a> by danah. It reminded me of lots of things bubbling around in my head before, such as Danny's <a href="http://www.oblomovka.com/entries/2003/10/13#1066058820">essay on the death of privacy online</a> and Chris Locke's <a href="http://mysticbourgeoisie.blogspot.com/">ongoing documentation of the self-esteem virus</a> (including <a href="http://www.chiefbloggingofficer.com/2007/03/advanced-hand-wringing.html"> this latest post</a>). As for reality TV, I also see it as <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005/01/strange-view-of-reality.html">a grab for extreme power over a few instead of diffuse power over many</a> by the broadcasters.</p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1890951293%26tag=epeusepigone-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1890951293%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002"><img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/1890951293.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" style="float:right;margin:10px"/></a><p>I'm also reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1890951293%26tag=epeusepigone-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1890951293%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Publics and Counterpublics</a> on danah's recommendation, which makes a distinction between the notion of the general public, and the different publics we are each addressing when blogging or making profiles on Social Network sites. In these activities we are performing to a public of our own, and we can feel invaded when a wider public pays attention, as in Danny's discussion above - danah has said that children's MySpace public includes 'everyone except parents and teachers'. Coping with fame becoming a smooth continuum rather than a sharp dichotomy is something else we need to work on in a power-law distributed long tail world.</p><p>Update: <a href="http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/004964.html">John Scalzi is grappling with simialr issues in his SFWA campaign</a>.<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/long tail" rel="tag">long tail</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/power law" rel="tag">power law</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/social" rel="tag">social</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/software" rel="tag">software</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/tagcamp" rel="tag">tagcamp</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

They do not use its advanced features, they just type stuff in.

  <span class="p-name">Missing the cage</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>When Rosie and I first came to the bay area in 1992, we visited San Francisco Zoo. One of the exhibits there were polar bears, and we watched one pace out a looping walk, his feet hitting the same spot each time through, one leg swinging out over the edge of the moat on each circuit. He was completely accustomed to his cage.</p><p>Reading <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/2/14/7063">Ars Technica's commentary on Airport Extreme's IPv6 support</a> reminded me of this. Apparently, if you use this device, your computers can route across the world again; people can connect to them from anywhere, just as the internet was designed to behave. That's what the 'inter' part of the name is about.</p><p>That's right, if you enable password protected services that are off by default, like ssh and ftp, on your Mac, the new Airport base stations actually route them, instead of requiring further buggering about with port mapping and explicit protocol translation through packet sniffing to get them to behave as they were designed. This gives Iljitsch van Beijnum a fit of conniptions, because he'd apparently rather rely on the illusionary security of a firewall then actually securing his machines services. Lets hope he doesn't own any laptops.</p><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Apple" rel="tag">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/internet" rel="tag">internet</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/security" rel="tag">security</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Wifi" rel="tag">Wifi</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Begoogled</span>

  <p>I joined Google this week, and am busy getting my head round its fractal complexities. Rosie wondered if I was begoogled (somewhere between bedazzled, beguiled and besotted).</p><p>Then, naturally, she googled 'begoogled' and found <a href="http://www.taketwoministries.com/blog/?p=467">this blogpost</a>, which uses it to mean something else.</p><p>Rosie then clicked on Chalicechick's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/ref=sv_wl_4/104-2834799-9496743">Buy me stuff, I'm cute</a> wishlist link, and, as she scrolled through it, became rather concerned.</p><p>What Rosie saw was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/A4VS67NQUN0F/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go/102-4274770-1308157">this list</a>, and as she progressed, she was increasingly worried about how much this random blogger girl had in common with me.</p><blockquote><p> "Glenn Gould?

  <span class="p-name">iPhone's great step back from iChat</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I did watch the iPhone Macworld Keynote last week - here's my chapter-list version of the stream so you can skip through it to the bits you find interesting:<br /><object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B" width="640" height="368" codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab" ><param name="src" value="http://media.ito.com/kevinmarks/macworld2007.mov"><param name="autoplay" value="false"><param name="controller" value="true"><embed src="http://media.ito.com/kevinmarks/macworld2007.mov" width="640" height="368" autoplay="false" controller="true" pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"></embed></object><br /><br />(I'd do the same for the download except 1. Apple obfuscated the url enough that I can't be arsed to packet sniff it out and 2. they still don't have HTTP 1.1 seeking support working right, despite me building and demoing it about 5 years ago).<br /><br />After watching it, my biggest surprise was how much of a step back it was from the rich interaction that iChat supports. With iChat you get presence info, chat, sending documents and integrated audio-video chat (when the other user's computer and connection supports it). Instead, iPhone had a legacy telco worldview baked in, with calls not conveying any further context (watch the combined demo near the end, where Jobs has to retype Schiller's email when talking to him on the phone). The iPhone has the camera on the wrong side to be a videophone, and Jobs did not mention any ability to make calls over Wifi rather than the Cingular network, or anything about IM (as opposed to SMS). <br /><br />My hope is that this is just Jobs not mentioning the features that don't demo well yet, but my sidekick's AIM integration is the reason I am so hooked on it; it buffers chats server-side so thatintermittent phone connections on the train don't interrupt conversation flow.

  <span class="p-name">Apple reverses the Osborne effect</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Apple has long kept its new product secrets close, wary that details leaking of new hardware will reduce sales of current products, just at the point where they are most profitable. I've written before how this culture spread unnecessarily into Apple's overall culture, and why they have missed a lot of the social media effects because of it. However, something has changed - both with the <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/specs.html"><strike>iTV</strike> AppleTV</a> and todays <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">iPhone</a><br /> announcement, Jobs is trumpeting new hardware months before it's available.</p><p>The difference here is that these are new categories for Apple, and the goal is to make customers wait for the Apple product instead of buying an alternative from someone else. By setting the price and broad features now, Jobs forces the competition's shipping product, based on last years technology and manufacturing costs to compete with what he will have in 6 months time. This is something that can only be done from a position of strength, which the iPod success gives him, but it is also a bit of a risk, as the product may disappoint.</p><p>I'm reserving judgment on the AppleTV until I see more details of what software it will run, in particular whether it can use Perian to play other video formats, and can use BitTorrent for HD podcasts, but it only having enough CPU oomph for 720p playback seems to be aiming low compared to a lot of existing Apple products, as well as the Xbox 360.</p><p>Update: Apple seems to understand the advantages of downloading media for later playback - these two new products both cache video locally in the great iPod tradition. So why on earth is the <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/j47d52oo/event/">keynote up as a stream</a>? I'd like to watch it on the train home tonight, so I want to download it, but no. Twits.</p><p>Update: Since I wrote this, it has shown up as <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=212293773&s=143441&i=13433123" >a podcast on the iTunes store</a>, so I will be able to watch it on the train on Monday. It's not linked from the Apple main page, so you may have missed this too; clearly there are still some internal Apple turf wars over this.</p><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Apple" rel="tag">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Macworld" rel="tag">Macworld </a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/iPhone" rel="tag">iPhone</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/AppleTV" rel="tag"> AppleTV </a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/HD" rel="tag">HD</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/HDTV" rel="tag">HDTV</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Live TV is Dead" rel="tag">Live TV is Dead</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">HDTV disappointments</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I spent a chunk of time looking at HDTVs in Best Buy and the Sony shop yesterday, and wasn't impressed. Overall, what I saw on the displays looked full of compression artefacts, with poor colour. Most of them were 720p displays, with the 1080p ones starting about $4,000. It seem there is <a href="http://www.engadgethd.com/2006/12/30/millions-miffed-at-poor-quality-from-holiday-hdtv-purchase/">some buyer's remorse around too</a>, as customers grapple with upconversion and, no doubt, with HDCP's deliberate degradation. It sounds like Pip Coburn's warning in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1591841321%26tag=epeusepigone-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1591841321%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">The Change Function</a> - that flat panel TV's are a no-brainer, but HDTV complexity could mess things up with extra perceived pain of adoption - was more accurate than <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/2006/11/28/a-little-ditty-about-web-video-and-hdtv/">Mark Cuban's 'HDTV beats the net'</a> rant.</p><p>I also had a look round the Apple store yesterday, and saw excellent HD quality on a $2000 HD iMac, and a $999 23" Cinema display (not to mention the $2000 30" display which is way beyond 1080p in size). Where did I get the HD content? Over the net - The <a href="http://apple.com/trailers/wb/harrypotterandtheorderofthephoenix/hd/"> Harry Potter 5 trailer</a> and <a href="http://download.movedigital.com/rocketboom">Rocketboom's HD edition</a>. The problem of connecting computers to HD screens is a mess, but it is one of the media industries' own creation, as they insisted on a new connector with DRM in the cables. Another friend of mine is working on some interesting new projection systems that may mean that all the computers will need is a white wall to point at.</p> <br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/DRM" rel="tag">DRM</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/HD" rel="tag">HD</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/HDTV" rel="tag">HDTV</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Live TV is Dead" rel="tag">Live TV is Dead</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">AT&T's bait and switch</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://scrawford.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/12/29/2604993.html">Susan Crawford explains the fraudulent concession to neutrality from AT&T</a> in an attempt to get their merger approved before the year-end. The small print excludes their 'IPTV' service from neutrality, which was the point at issue. I have <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/04/video-on-net-is-solved-problem-many.html">already covered the underlying flaw in their special pleading</a>; what we see is a bizarre coalition of legacy TV and legacy networking to sacrifice the low-latency traffic paths we need for gaming, two-way conversations and other communication servcies for the goal of replicating the 'you have to watch it right now' TV experience we are rejecting in droves now we have a choice.<br />Update: The <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-269275A1.pdf">FCC approved it anyway</a>, and watered down the neutrality commitment further:<blockquote>AT&T made a series of voluntary commitments that are enforceable by the Commission and attached as an Appendix. These conditions are voluntary, enforceable commitments by AT&T but are not general statements of Commission policy and do not alter Commission precedent or bind future Commission policy or rules. </blockquote><br /><a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-269275A4.pdf">Commissioner Adelstein seemed to think there was a new policy here:</a><blockquote>Most significantly, the Commission takes a long-awaited and momentous step in this Order by requiring the applicants to maintain neutral network and neutral routing in the provision of their wireline broadband Internet access service. This provision was critical for my support of this merger and will serve as a “5th principle,” ensuring that the combined company does not privilege, degrade, or prioritize the traffic of Internet content, applications or service providers, including their own affiliates. Given the increase in concentration presented by this transaction – particularly set against the backdrop of a market in which telephone and cable operators control nearly 98 percent of the market, with many consumers lacking any meaningful choice of providers – it was critical that the Commission add a principle to address incentives for anti-competitive discrimination. Defining the exact parameters of any neutrality provision is, almost by definition, complex and difficult. The precise contours, scope, and exclusions in this provision reflect compromise and a predictive judgment about how, in the words of Prof. Tim Wu, “to preserve the most attractive features of the Internet as it now exists.” The work is not done, however. It is critical that we remain vigilant and continue to explore comprehensive approaches to this issue; but I expect this significant step will inform the debate in the coming months and years. I appreciate the efforts of the many diverse groups and individuals who have contributed to this effort and, in particular, I want to thank Commissioner Copps for his leadership on this issue and for his commitment to the effort to devise a carefully-crafted condition.</blockquote><br />Looks like he got bait and switched too.

  <span class="p-name">iTunes store - because of, not with</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/11/technology/11drill.html?ex=1323493200&en=c1a19ba1817432c7&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">The NYT repeats a familiar incredulity about iTunes store sales</a> but misses the point about Apple. Apple is a hardware company — it makes its money from selling good hardware with good margins. The iTunes Store has always been pretty close to revenue neutral for Apple - the vast bulk of its sales revenue goes through to the Record Labels or TV companies. With Apple absorbing hosting, payment processing and customer support too, I'd be surpised if it makes enough to cover the iPod's advertising budget.<br />This has an interesting beneficial effect - because Apple cares more about the iPod than the Store, they have embraced Podcasting (equally revenue neutral, and a good way to fill iPods) and kept the iTunes Application's CD-ripping abilities (while its ability to sync to non-Apple mp3 players has withered away). What is becoming clear is that DRM, even Apple's DRM with circumvention built-in, does destroy value for customers. The labels are realising that they inadvertently handed the keys to their music to Apple, and so are moving towards selling non-DRM'd files instead.<br />Apple's hardware sales model is going to be put to the test with the iTV set-top video playback box due next year. Other companies are bundling such boxes with cable TV, in return for a subscription. <a href="http://btvision.bt.con">BT Vision is trying a different tactic</a> - a set-top PVR that uses free over-the-air TV along with the ability to purchase Video too, but bundled with their broadband internet service.<br />The question for both of these is how well they will enable the playback of amateur media, which can be indistinguishable from 'bootlegs', as well as video from the big media content the companies have partnerships with.<br />Watching my boys play videos with their friends the other night, they didn't make hard distinctions between the <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?client=safari&amp;rls=en-gb&amp;q=harry%20potter%205&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wv">Harry Potter 5 trailer</a>, <a href="http://funnyjunk.com/flash/rating">silly internet flash animations</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search_type=search_videos&amp;search_query=canon&amp;search_sort=video_avg_rating&amp;search_category=0">Pachelbel's Canon in D played on guitar</a>, and their <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search_type=search_videos&amp;search_query=canon&amp;search_sort=video_avg_rating&amp;search_category=0">own home-made videos</a>.

  <span class="p-name">Gowers' biased rhetoric</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>The <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/gowers_review_intellectual_property/gowersreview_index.cfm">Gowers Review of Intellectual property</a> released a <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/53F/C8/pbr06_gowers_report_755.pdf">final report</a> today. The Open Rights Group has a <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/open-rights-group-welcomes-gowers-review/">good response on the overall impact</a>, but I noticed some rhetorical bias. Paragraph 1.9 of the report says:</p><blockquote><p>1.9 Achieving this balance is made more difficult by the vocabulary used to discuss IP policy and practice. Copyright infringement through unauthorised copying and distribution of music and video across the Internet is likened to stealing by some, and to sharing by others. Those who seek to prevent others from using a patented invention without permission are branded ‘trolls’<a href='#troll'>*</a>. Those who copy and distribute material illegally are called ‘pirates’. And the problem of ‘orphan’ works, which arises where copyright owners are untraceable, perhaps provokes an easy sympathy.</p></blockquote><p>Having made this point though, the rest of the review uses 'piracy' throughout in phrases like 'strengthening enforcement of IP rights, whether through clamping down on piracy or trade in counterfeit goods', and does not mention patent trolling at all. Down in the glossary at the end, the report defines:</p><blockquote> Piracy: Unauthorised duplication of goods protected by IP law</blockquote><p>By using this rhetorical trick, Gowers continually makes an equivalence between commercial counterfeiting of CDs on a large scale with the copying inherent and necessary in any use of digital media. Gowers also makes some bizarre leaps of logic:</p><blockquote><p>1.4 Ideas are expensive to produce but cheap to copy. The fixed costs of producing knowledge are high. Hollywood blockbusters can costs hundreds of millions of dollars to make[...]</p></blockquote><p>How much knowledge does a Hollywood blockbuster contain, compared to, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">the Wikipedia page on intellectual property</a>? The fixed costs there are remarkably low. The costs of production are continually plummeting, thanks to digital technologies, and that enables commons-based peer production, like Wikipedia. Some of Gowers recommendations are good, but it looks like he didn't engage with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0300110561%26tag=epeusepigone-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0300110561%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Benkler's Wealth of Networks</a> thesis on new kinds of knowledge creation.<p><a name="troll">*</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll">Patent trolling</a> is when a patent is used to prevent innovation by blackmailing companies with a patent, often second-hand.

  <span class="p-name">Paradise regained?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/11/paradise_lost.php">Nick Carr characteristically sees doom</a> in Second Life's copybot, via <a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1959716,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=20">Alex Krotoski</a>:<blockquote><p>Krotoski saw, in the reaction of the new merchant class, that something more than his little laboratory had disappeared from the virtual world:</p><blockquote><p>And so, once again, the real world comes crashing in. Sooner or later, most online communities reach this crisis point because the ideals of the founders are replaced by regulations demanded by the different types of people who interact in them. We shouldn't be surprised; what we do when we interact online is replicate the social practices we are familiar with offline. Inspired by this milestone, I'm going to add a wing to my new lab. And inside will be a shrine to CopyBot, the little hack that transformed Second Life into a real world.</p></blockquote><p>Lay a virtual rose on the shrine for me, Aleks.</p></blockquote><p>Now, I've quoted <a href="http://www.baen.com/library/palaver4.htm">Macaulay</a> on this before, but his clarity of thought is hard to resist on Milton:</p><blockquote>If, Sir, I wished to find a strong and perfect illustration of the effects which I anticipate from long copyright, I should select,—my honourable and learned friend will be surprised,—I should select the case of Milton's granddaughter. As often as this bill has been under discussion, the fate of Milton's granddaughter has been brought forward by the advocates of monopoly. My honourable and learned friend has repeatedly told the story with great eloquence and effect. He has dilated on the sufferings, on the abject poverty, of this ill-fated woman, the last of an illustrious race. He tells us that, in the extremity of her distress, Garrick gave her a benefit, that Johnson wrote a prologue, and that the public contributed some hundreds of pounds. Was it fit, he asks, that she should receive, in this eleemosynary form, a small portion of what was in truth a debt? Why, he asks, instead of obtaining a pittance from charity, did she not live in comfort and luxury on the proceeds of the sale of her ancestor's works? But, Sir, will my honourable and learned friend tell me that this event, which he has so often and so pathetically described, was caused by the shortness of the term of copyright? Why, at that time, the duration of copyright was longer than even he, at present, proposes to make it. The monopoly lasted, not sixty years, but for ever. At the time at which Milton's granddaughter asked charity, Milton's works were the exclusive property of a bookseller. Within a few months of the day on which the benefit was given at Garrick's theatre, the holder of the copyright of Paradise Lost,—I think it was Tonson,—applied to the Court of Chancery for an injunction against a bookseller who had published a cheap edition of the great epic poem, and obtained the injunction. The representation of Comus was, if I remember rightly, in 1750; the injunction in 1752. Here, then, is a perfect illustration of the effect of long copyright. Milton's works are the property of a single publisher. Everybody who wants them must buy them at Tonson's shop, and at Tonson's price. Whoever attempts to undersell Tonson is harassed with legal proceedings. Thousands who would gladly possess a copy of Paradise Lost, must forego that great enjoyment. And what, in the meantime, is the situation of the only person for whom we can suppose that the author, protected at such a cost to the public, was at all interested? She is reduced to utter destitution. Milton's works are under a monopoly. Milton's granddaughter is starving. The reader is pillaged; but the writer's family is not enriched. Society is taxed doubly. It has to give an exorbitant price for the poems; and it has at the same time to give alms to the only surviving descendant of the poet.</p></blockquote><p>we can change society's rules, and we do it by experimenting near the edges</p><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/copyright" rel="tag">copyright</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2006/11/04/on-filmmaking-and-software-development-part-1/">JP made an analogy between software development and film-making</a>:<blockquote><h4>Only successful scripts should get financed</h4><p>That’s what angels want first and foremost. Good scripts. Because they know that they can get good producers, good directors, good actors, good everything. But good scripts are harder to come by.</p><p>BTW, have you ever wondered why angel investors exist in only two investment genres, filmmaking and software development? Now you know.</p></blockquote><p><br />Now JP does mention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_hell">development hell</a>, which was best described by <a href="http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1109313-4,00.html">Joss Whedon and Neil Gaiman</a>:<blockquote><p><cite>Whedon</cite>: <q>I find that when you read a script, or rewrite something, or look at something that's been gone over, you can tell, like rings on a tree, by how bad it is, how long it's been in development.</q></p><p><cite>Gaiman</cite>: <q>Yes. It really is this thing of executives loving the smell of their own urine and urinating on things. And then more execs come in, and they urinate. And then the next round.

  <span class="p-name">Don't use Wells Fargo as your bank</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Their online banking seems attractive, but it has a fatal flaw.</p><p>It doesn't show a running balance with each transaction, just a mythical 'available balance', and a long list of 'pending' transactions. The trouble is, the pending transactions become actual at different times. In particular, any debits become actual before any credits. So, if you have a large pending deposit of, say, your salary, a few small transactions that come through first can take you overdrawn. Wells Fargo will then charge you $33 per transaction for these overdraft transactions. The $33 doesn't pend at all, it just disappears from your account into their profits, along with all the interest they are earning on 'pending' your deposits.</p><p> As I said, avoid Wells Fargo banking.</p> <br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/banking" rel="tag">banking</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ethics" rel="tag">ethics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/extortion" rel="tag">extortion</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Wells Fargo" rel="tag">Wells Fargo</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1924846,00.html">Armando Iannucci explains that comedy is making the serious points in politics</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I still want comedy to matter a great deal. I want it to tackle big subjects. The idea that we are making someone laugh about something does not mean we don't take it seriously. Sometimes, we can take something so seriously that the only practical way to release the tension is to make a joke. Sometimes, we can be so appalled by someone's behaviour that the only effective way to run it again in our heads is as farce. Luckily, we do not live under tyranny, but those who do so know the creative freedom the joke gives them. You can ban writing, but you can't stop people finding things funny.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.ucomics.com/foxtrot/2006/10/29/">Bill Amend illustrates the point</a>:</p><p><img src="http://media.ito.com/kevinmarks/foxvote.png"/></p><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/cartoon" rel="tag">cartoon</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/comedy" rel="tag">comedy</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/funny" rel="tag">funny</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/voting" rel="tag">voting</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>The European Union's plan to regulate the net as if it were TV - <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/orgwiki/index.php/TV_Without_Frontiers_Directive">Television Without Frontiers</a> - picked up a <a href="http://technorati.com/search/technology.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20411-2407359,00.html">lot of attention in blogs this week</a>, after <a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20411-2407359,00.html">the Times covered it</a>.</p.<p> The basic idea is flawed - TV involves handing a monopoly over spectrum to organisations, so regulating how they use it makes some sense, but there is no spectrum scarcity online, all you need is a webserver.

  <span class="p-name">How could Flash video stop being crappy?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/jd/archives/2006/10/5-point_anti-fl.cfm">John Dowdell graciously responded to my attack on Flash video</a>, asking for more solid points, which is fair enough - I did rather assume that Flash video's flaws are self-evident. This post is adapted from our conversation in his comments.</p><p>First of all, let me say that Flash gets one big thing right, which is unobtrusive ubiquity. <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/the_rise_of_flash_video_part_1/">Tom Green's history</a> is spot on about the stupidly self-destructive things that Real, QuickTime and Microsoft have done to get in your way when you want to watch video, from DRM to pop-up ads to pointless upgrade messages that don't upgrade anything. Flash started with a ubiquitous vector graphics player, and added audio as mp3, and video too, without inserting noxious upgrade messages in the way.</p><p>I'm not saying making computers play video is easy — I've lost enough nights and weekends to synchronisation and graphical representation bugs to know — but there are some egregious things wrong with FLV:</p><br /><h4>Flash frequently drops sync</h4><p>In particular, if I switch focus away from the browser on my Mac, the video framerate drops to a crawl, then plays catch-up when I click back.</p><p>Dowdell puts this down to browser issues, but QuickTime handles these through a shared process on Windows - it is fixable, though takes some work.</p><br /><h4>Native video integration is weak</h4><p>Scaling video always looks pixellated, and the black/white points and gamma mapping is off so it often looks washed out. (Yes, this is tricky, but it is a known problem too - <a href="http://developer.apple.com/quicktime/icefloe/dispatch027.html">here's some QuickTime notes from 2000</a>).</p><br /><h4>Proprietary old codecs</h4><p>FLV uses proprietary codecs that are well behind the state of the art, giving a bottleneck of encoding choices. Most Flash Video is encoded to the old Sorenson Spark codec (which is effectively <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H263">H263</a> - a standard but a ten-year-old one).</p><p><a href="http://www.kaourantin.net/2005/08/quest-for-new-video-codec-in-flash-8.html">Macromedia considered H264</a>, but likely rejected it on legacy support as it is CPU intensive. The big mistake was adopting ON2 VP6 instead of MPEG4 main profile. MPEG4 has benefited from multiple encoding tools and playback clients, their codec requires proprietary encoders. If Macromedia/Adobe can adopt MPEG4 main profile in the next Flash release, great. H264 would be even better, but staying a generation behind is arguably reasonable, given CPU requirements.</p><br /><h4>Lack of editability</h4><p>QuickTime was always designed with editing in mind. Apple have foolishly buried this feature, but it is there, and one advantage of MPEG4 video is that you can bring it into QuickTime, edit it, and flatten it out again without recompression. Getting video out of Flash again is a pain (some tools do it, generally with recompression).</p><p>I don't think QuickTime is the ultimate answer either, and I don't want this to become a pissing contest over individual platforms. What I want is some open standards support.</p><p>Dowdell worries about commoditization, but that is exactly what I want. If MPEG4 video playback can become a commodity, as MP3 audio is, the market can move on to compete on other grounds. Look how many Flash-based mp3 players there are out there.</p><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Flash" rel="tag">Flash</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/QuickTime" rel="tag">QuickTime</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Self-evolving systems - threat or promise?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>The <a href="http://lifeboat.com/ex/warning.signs.for.tomorrow">Lifeboat foundation is thinking about future threats</a>. I was struck by this one:</p><img alt="Self Evolving System" width="120" src="http://lifeboat.com/images/self-evolving.system.warning.jpg" style="float:left;" /><blockquote><p>A system that evolves freely is potentially very adaptable and creative. It could also become nearly anything, with consequences ranging from the annoying to the disastrous. It is likely unlimited self-evolution will need to be contained carefully even as we mine it for truly new inventions. The arrows nicely hint at a chaos-star as well as replication.</p></blockquote><p>Somehow this reminded me of <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2006/10/14/preelection_cyn.html">danah's exasperation with politics, business, academia and media</a>. The disappointing elites she describes would see self-evolving systems as a threat.

  <p>Now YouTube has Google backing, they can stop making us watch Flash video. Everyone who cares about video quality, from <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">Hollywood</a>, to the <a href="http://demonoid.com/files/">BitTorrent-using TV bootleggers</a> use mpeg4. Everyone who doesn't uses Flash.</p><br /><p>I've pointed out before <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/01/how-apple-lost-its-web-video-mojo-and.html">how Apple screwed things up</a>, but it is still fixable.

Google Video has nice MPEG4 versions, but they force you to download them completely and play later. Stop that.</li><br /><li>Apple, make QT play DiVX AVIs and the other MPEG4 variants. You have the codecs, you have the parsing, you have the engineers. You should have done this 5 years ago. Heck, just bundle <a href="http://perian.org/">Perian</a> and port it to Windows.</li><br /><li>Google, drop your client, adopt <a href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Democracy Player</a> and promote it.</li><br /><li>Everyone: forget DRM.</li><br /></ol><br /><p>After all we deserve better than having to put up with <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/the_rise_of_flash_video_part_1/">Flash video</a>.</p><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Apple" rel="tag">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/DRM" rel="tag">DRM</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/formats" rel="tag">formats</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Google" rel="tag">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/iPod" rel="tag">iPod</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Live TV is Dead" rel="tag">Live TV is Dead</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/movie" rel="tag">movie</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/pirate" rel="tag">pirate</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/podcasting" rel="tag">podcasting</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/QuickTime" rel="tag">QuickTime</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/YouTube" rel="tag">YouTube</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/09/28#elementaryMyDearReverend">Doc</a> wrote about Vendor Management Systems to counter Customer Management Sytems.<br /><br />One technique I picked up from Stuart is to register a domain (preferably your own name), and forward any email to it to your inbox. Then, when you need to give a vendor an email address, give them their name at yours, eg godaddy@kevinmarks.com. That way, if the subsequently get spam, or <a href="http://technorati.com/weblog/2006/10/125.html">unexpected mail</a>, you know who it was. This can confuse people on the phone though - "what's your email?" "earthlink@kevinmarks.com" "Don't you mean kevinmarks@earthlink.com ?" "Nope".<br /><br /><a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/09/30.html#When:10:32:44AM">Dave</a> wants a way to keep his movie reviews where he controls his own data.

  <span class="p-name">iTunes store hobbled by DRM</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5350258.stm">The Beeb misses the point a bit</a>:<blockquote><p>On average, the study reports, only 5% of the music on an iPod will be bought from online music stores. The rest will be from CDs the owner of an MP3 player already has or tracks they have downloaded from file-sharing sites.</p><p>The report warned against simple characterisations of the music-buying public that divide people into those that pay and those that pirate.</p></blockquote>The glaring omission in that report is of course podcasts, which have shown huge growth, and have been part of the iPod and iTunes experience for over a year now.<br /><p>Even though I got $250 of credit on the iTunes Music store from ValleyWag, we have been reluctant to spend it, compared to buying CDs from Amazon. The need to burn your own CDs after purchase (to be sure that the tracks don't vaporize next time you have disk trouble) is a significant extra burden, driven by the DRM. Apple's sync-back from iPods to computers in the new iTunes is a step in the right direction, but a more sensible policy towards failed or deleted downloads is long overdue - failed TV show downloads, and purchases lost through disk failure meet with shrugs from Apple.</p><p>From Apple's point of view, the iTunes store is a small part of their business - the bulk of the money passing through it goes straight to the rights-holders or in payment processing or bandwidth costs, while they make far more revenue and profit on the iPods themselves. Overall this is a good thing - if Apple were really beholden to the labels and studios for significant revenue, then online culture would be in worse trouble. As it is, Apple's neutrality means that they are happy to encourage podcasters to show up in their listings, as more media means more iPod sales.</p><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/audio" rel="tag">audio</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/iPod" rel="tag">iPod</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/iTunes" rel="tag">iTunes</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/podcasting" rel="tag">podcasting</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">In Memoriam Rob (lilo) Levin</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Rob Levin, the leading spirit behind the <a href="http://freenode.net/">freenode</a> IRC network, <a href="http://freenode.net/news.shtml">died yesterday</a> from injuries sustained by being hit by a car while cycling. <br />I never met Rob in person, but his indefatigable work in keeping freenode running supported hundreds of conversations I have had with people around the world, many becoming friends, colleagues or collaborators, and I counted him as a friend. I was hired at Technorati through a conversation on freenode, and the #microformats, #technorati, #wordpress, #wikinews and of course #joiito channels are a key part of my online life.<br />When setting up transient channels for conference backchannels, Rob was always helpful and courteous. I am sad to hear of his death, and the best memorial would be to keep freenode and the <a href="http://freenode.net/pdpc_donations.shtml">PDPC</a> going as he did so well.<br />Lilo's accounts are still logged in at freenode, and every so often jibot reminds us:<br /><blockquote>lilo is the executive director of Peer-Directed Projects Center in Houston, Texas &#38; he's another boring cooperativist propertarian Peircean pragmatist anarchist &#38; he runs freenode (http://freenode.net/) &#38; certainly hasn't been getting more sleep lately &#38; is working on freenode-registry in Ruby &#38; blogs on http://spinhome.org/ &#38; http://bloggage.org/ &#38; also uses the nick 'somegeek' &#38; passed away Sep 16th, 2006 (RIP)</blockquote><br /><br />Update: Rob spent his days in a constant battle to keep freenode as a place for civil discourse, fighting off trolls, spammers and other net parasites.

  <span class="p-name">Douglas Adams' Hyperland</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I got a surprise birthday present today. 17 years ago, when I was at the BBC, my colleagues Max Whitby, Nikki Barton and Chris Prior put together this amazing drama-documentary with Douglas Adams on the future of media. Using 8-bit animated icons keyed over video, they predicted the future of digital media in ways that are only now coming true. <br />There is a version up on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5579362191486305681">Google Video</a>, but I also cached it on the server I use in case the BBC's 'no-one outside the UK' policy whisks it away from us again. <a href="http://media.ito.com/kevinmarks/hyperland.mp4" rel="enclosure" >Download Hyperland here</a>, and join me in remembering Douglas Adams.<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/BBC" rel="tag">BBC</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/culture" rel="tag">culture</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Douglas Adams" rel="tag">Douglas Adams</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Hyperland" rel="tag">Hyperland</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/hyperlinks" rel="tag">hyperlinks</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Live TV is Dead" rel="tag">Live TV is Dead</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/movie" rel="tag">movie</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Apple's announcements - unanswered questions</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Reading <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/12/live-from-the-steve-jobs-keynote-its-showtime/">Paul Boutin's coverage</a> of Apple's video announcements today, There are several questions that come to mind (and I know Jobs prefers not to answer questions).<br /><ul><li>Songs bought from iTunes can be burned to CD and play anywhere. Why can't movies and TV shows bought from iTunes be burned to DVD?</li><li>Could this explain why they have sold over a billion songs but only 45 million TV shows?</li><li>Jobs talked about 640x480 movies. The <a href="http://images.apple.com/home/2006/images/ipodmovieshero20060629.jpg">Apple screenshot shows Pirates of the Caribbean filling the screen</a>. Does this mean they are selling pan-and-scan versions, not widescreen? (checking with the iTunes Store, Pirates is widescreen, which makes sense)</li><li>Apple's pre-announced iTV box has an HDMI output, but looks like it is running Mac OS - does it implement HDCP-style downrezzing?</li><li>In other words, will it play HD content made by independents cleanly, or will it require broadcast flag handshakes?</li></ul><br />What this does illustrate is that the telco's coveting of the Cableco's TV revenues may be irrelevant. As I have pointed out, <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/04/video-on-net-is-solved-problem-many.html">their model of delivering TV by real-time streaming</a>, requiring massive upgrades to their aging networks, can be completely short-circuited by downloading movies and TV over current broadband, scaling from slower than real time to faster than realtime depending on connection speed and congestion.<br />Bittorrent users have been doing this for a while. Apple is making it more convenient and much easier to use than most cable set-top boxes, let alone whatever the telcos are likely to come up with. It all <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006/04/abcs-tv-on-demand-sounds-unattractive.html">adds to the alternatives</a>.<br />The real revolution is hinted at by Jobs showing <a href="http://rocketboom.com">Rocketboom</a> in his set-top box demo. Chatting to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/67111878@N00/239232935/">Andrew and Joanne</a> this weekend in Boston, it is clear that they <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_video_blog?user=lonelygirl15">and others</a> are growing their audiences and ready to short-circuit the existing <a href="http://www.quernstone.com/archives/2006/09/childrens_tv_br.html">broadcast</a> or <a href="http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1109313-4,00.html">Hollywood</a> commissioning treadmill.<br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Apple" rel="tag">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/DRM" rel="tag">DRM</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/HD" rel="tag">HD</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/PodCamp" rel="tag">PodCamp</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/podcasting" rel="tag">podcasting</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Rocketboom" rel="tag">Rocketboom</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/showtime" rel="tag">Showtime</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Apple's HD Future</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  With another Steve Jobs keynote about to kick off, I'm going to indulge in a little speculation. Apple will greatly embrace HD. This shouldn't be a big surprise -after all back when I was there, the high-end uncompressed HD editing in Final Cut took off, but at the time uncompressed was needed as a way to keep the slow CPU out of the way of the fast disk and screen. Since then, Moore's Law has meant that <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/guide/hd/recommendations.html">computers are now almost fast enough to decode HD across the range</a>, so <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">HD Movie Trailers</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie HD</a> are both widespread.<br />With Apple about to refresh their high end range, I expect a big emphasis on HD, and Blue-Ray storage. The more interesting aspect is that Apple is well-placed to do and end-run around HDCP/HDMI and all that nonsense, as they sell the screens as well as the computers. The iTunes store has been selling low-res TV shows for $2 each, so they have the makings of an entire distribution chain for content.<br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Apple" rel="tag">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/WWDC" rel="tag">WWDC</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Blogher - a peer group and a stiff drink</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I didn't attend <a href="http://blogher.org/topic/blogher-conference">Blogher</a>, but many of my friends and colleagues did, and mostly got lots out of it. I did pick up an undercurrent of discomfort from my female geek friends at what they saw as the low tech content of the conference, and even 'all these women in high heels giggling together'. <a href="http://sourduck.blogspot.com/2006/07/goodbye-grassroots-blogher.html">Melinda Casino</a>, <a href="http://bbgun.burningbird.net/weblogging/measuring-success/">Shelley Powers</a> and <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2006/07/blogher-and-issue-of-unctuousness.html">Tara Hunt</a> express various concerns with tone and with intrusive sponsorship.</p><br /><p>The problems of sponsorship and product pitches always intrude into conferences - with the <a href="http://barcamp.org/">BarCamp</a> model they get minimised by the low budget ethos and emphasis on emergent scheduling, but having watched several friends put together big conferences that involve taking over hotels for a few days, the need to raise significant sponsorship money does lead to editorial pressure on the schedule, and it difficult to walk the line between <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_11_01_epeus_archive.html#106812371392494147">Jane Jacobs' Commercial and Guardian</a> modes.</p><br /><p>However, reading some of the posts by non-techie Blogher attendees, like <a href="http://izzymom.com/2006/08/01/i-laughed-i-cried/">IzzyMom</a> and <a href="http://www.tastetheworld.org/blog/2006/07/home_again_home_again_jiggity.php">tastetheworld</a>, what I see is the sheer pleasure at meeting people you have only known through their online writing, and making the personal connection with them. I recognise the experience I had when I <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_04_01_epeus_archive.html#200186417">crashed O'Reilly's eTech in 2003</a>, and was able to pick up conversations with people based on what we'd been writing about, and overcome my previous inability to make smalltalk in big groups. The continual growth of blogging means that there are now many more interest groups out there beyond my techie clan. Lisa, Jory, Elise and the other Blogher organisers enabled lots of women with different interests to get together and have these personal epiphanies, and resolve Ford Prefect's quest for 'a peer group and a stiff drink' - well done.</p><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Barcamp" rel="tag">Barcamp</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Blogher" rel="tag">Blogher</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/blogs" rel="tag">blogs</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/conference" rel="tag">conference</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/emergence" rel="tag">emergence</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/etech" rel="tag">etech</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Heads or Tails? No, Heads and Tails</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I'm seeing a lot of debate over power law distributions in the wake of Chris Anderson's Long Tail book, most recently debated by <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115387606762117314-Inp5lUxHwVDwS_SJv5zaQShPXlE_20070726.html?mod=blogs">Lee Gomes in the WSJ</a>. <a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/07/factchecking_my.html">Chris's rebuttal</a> is on point, but there are more subtleties here; Chris is primarily addressing retailers in his book, so even the longer tails of books and music he discusses are choked off by the original publishers. If you include the lovingly created media from amateur creators, such as <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/blogpower.html">we see in the weblog world</a>, the tails extend still further. (The chart dates back to <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2004_02_01_epeus_archive.html#107643580773213734">February 2004</a>.)</p><p>At dinner after AlwaysOn tonight, I was chatting to Nik Cubrilovic of <a href="http://omnidrive.com">Omnidrive</a> and Peter Pham of <a href="http://photobucket.com">PhotoBucket</a>. They both have businesses hosting data online, for individuals. These are pure Long Tail businesses - as I said in my <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006_06_01_epeus_archive.html#115113680226301321">Symmetry</a> argument, we are moving to a world where we upload as much as we download. As <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2006/07/25/four-pillars-four-more-themes-before-the-next-recap/">JP discussed</a>, and Peter confirmed, having lots of photos and videos viewed once or zero times makes caching near the client useless.</p><p>However, that doesn't mean there aren't still some big hits, and if you have a power law relationship that extends over a few orders of magnitude you do need to cope with both ends of it, often with very different mechanisms. Desiging for an average case fials in a long tail world. Satellite broadcast is the ultimate big head method, blanketing whole continents with identical signals, with broadcast TV a close second. Building out networks with only emulating this model in mind will fail.</p><br /><p>As <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_10_01_epeus_archive.html#106707720560866717">I said before</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The net extends the range of the power law distribution.</p> <br /><p>If you look at relative popularity on the web, using something like Technorati, you get a power law curve that goes all the way down smoothly, to the bottom where you see pages that got just a single link.</p> <p>If you look at popularity in the publishing world - movies, chart music or books - the curve starts out with a power law, but soon drops like a stone. That's because in order to get a movie made, a recording contract or a book published, you have to convince somebody that you're going to sell a million tickets, a hundred thousand CDs or tens of thousands of books.</p> <p>You end up in a zero-sum game, where people pour enormous resources into being number one, because number two is only half as good. The promise of the net is that the power of all those little links can outweigh the power of the top ten.</p></blockquote><p>So what are the long tail businesses? You can be a commodity business catering to the tail (commodities are good - they mean people will pay you a known price). You can be fashion business, joining the zero-sum game for top place. Or you can create with love, and see if you can get paid for it over time.</p><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/long tail" rel="tag">long tail</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Inspired mashups - Star Trek/Python and more</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>While exploring the latest things my spiders have uncovered - often an interesting journey through the collective cosnsciousness - I found my way to a <a href="http://seacouver.slashcity.net/vidland/vids.html">collection of inspired mashups</a>. These artists have taken songs with a cultural resonance, and mixed them with video from another genre entirely to create something new and striking, but that partakes of both.</p><br /><p>OK, that sounds pompous, especially when I'm talking about <a href="http://seacouver.slashcity.net/vidland/kotr_divx.zip" rel="enclosure alternate">Star Trek characters acting the Camelot song from Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a> (also seen in a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ptx98LTGyfE&amp;search=star%20trek%20camelot" rel="enclosure alternate">lower quality YouTube version</a>), but there is a deeper point here. In Lessig's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0143034650%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0143034650%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Free Culture</a>, <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/">Chapter 8 Transformers</a>, he writes:<blockquote>In February 2003, DreamWorks studios announced an agreement with Mike Myers, the comic genius of /Saturday Night Live/ and Austin Powers. According to the announcement, Myers and DreamWorks would work together to form a "unique filmmaking pact." Under the agreement, DreamWorks "will acquire the rights to existing motion picture hits and classics, write new storylines and--with the use of state-of-the-art digital technology--insert Myers and other actors into the film, thereby creating an entirely new piece of entertainment." The announcement called this "film sampling." As Myers explained, "Film Sampling is an exciting way to put an original spin on existing films and allow audiences to see old movies in a new light. Rap artists have been doing this for years with music and now we are able to take that same concept and apply it to film." Steven Spielberg is quoted as saying, "If anyone can create a way to bring old films to new audiences, it is Mike." Spielberg is right. Film sampling by Myers will be brilliant. But if you don't think about it, you might miss the truly astonishing point about this announcement. As the vast majority of our film heritage remains under copyright, the real meaning of the DreamWorks announcement is just this: It is Mike Myers and only Mike Myers who is free to sample. Any general freedom to build upon the film archive of our culture, a freedom in other contexts presumed for us all, is now a privilege reserved for the funny and famous--and presumably rich. This privilege becomes reserved for two sorts of reasons. The first continues the story of the last chapter: the vagueness of "fair use." Much of "sampling" should be considered "fair use." But few would rely upon so weak a doctrine to create. That leads to the second reason that the privilege is reserved for the few: The costs of negotiating the legal rights for the creative reuse of content are astronomically high. These costs mirror the costs with fair use: You either pay a lawyer to defend your fair use rights or pay a lawyer to track down permissions so you don't have to rely upon fair use rights. Either way, the creative process is a process of paying lawyers--again a privilege, or perhaps a curse, reserved for the few.</blockquote><br /><p>After all, what is the impact of these amateur (in the true sense of lovingly made) remixes? I want to share them with people. I showed it to <a href="http://funnystories.blogspot.com/">Andrew</a>, and realised that though he knows <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00005O3VC%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00005O3VC%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a>, he hasn't seen the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B0002I831S%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B0002I831S%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Star Trek</a>, so guess what's on my Netflix list now.</p><p>I hope the Pythons and Paramount (or whoever owns Star Trek these days), are smart enough to turn a blind eye to this kind of cherishing of cultural icons.</p><p>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0060934344%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0060934344%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Don Quixote</a>. Not only was it a moving and subtle work, but I was amazed at the playfulness with unreliable narrators, and the way the characters meet people who've read the first book in the second one.

  The <a href="http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7141363">Economist on iTunes</a>: <blockquote>Because the music store is only compatible with the iPod, a customer who wants to abandon Apple's player in favour of something else must replace all the music he downloaded from the store. It is as though a person's entire record collection worked on only one brand of gramophone. Hence with each song a customer buys, he binds himself a little more tightly to the iPod. Apple offers its customers a 'Trojan horse', according to Mr Shope. Customers embrace its iconic device, and then, like the hapless Trojans, find they have fallen into the hands of the gift-givers.</blockquote><br />This thesis is only supportable if you ignore the original feature of iTunes, it's ability to burn CDs. Long before the iTunes Music Store, Apple ran the <a href="http://a772.g.akamai.net/5/772/51/3435fc99fd3a89/1a1a1aaa2198c627970773d80669d84574a8d80d3cb12453c02589f25382e353c32f94c326950366cb3db1/itunes_concert-long-sref.mov" rel="enclosure">Rip, Mix Burn ad campaign</a>, saying 'it's your music - burn it on a Mac'. When they introduced the iTMS, they retained this feature, so you can burn Red Book, uncompressed, unencrypted CDs of your iTunes Store purchases.<br />This is in fact the only reason I buy music from iTMS - if you do, make sure you burn the CDs as backups. And don't buy the videos - you can't burn them to DVD.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>The <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-7352_3-6086437.html">FCC has imposed Universal Service Fund taxes</a> on VoIP services that connect to the legacy phone network. USF is allegedly a way to bring services to rural and low-income communities, but in practice is outdoor relief for big telcos. I assume that the telco lobbyists see this as a victory, but as it only applies to interconnecting services, those that are pure internet services now have an even bigger cost advantage.</p><p>As for subsidising communications for low income users, it looks like the internet is doing a far better job by making everything cheap or free, as <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71153-0.html"> even the homeless are connected to the net</a>.<br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Supernova" rel="tag">Supernova</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/telco" rel="tag">telco</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/USF" rel="tag">USF</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/VoIP" rel="tag">VoIP</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/06/13.html#videoAtVloggercon">Dave Winer managed to stir up a storm</a> by capturing a video of John Dvorak confessing how he trolls Mac users for extra pageviews. Although Dave posted the video in QuickTime format using open codecs (JPEG video and 8-bit uncompressed audio), which <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006_06_01_epeus_archive.html#115049215333802361">should mollify</a> <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/16/juggling-oranges">Mark Pilgrim</a> somewhat, the iPod Video won't play this. I converted it using the handy iSquint tool into standard mpeg-4 files. I present 3 alternatives for you:</p><br /><ol class="alternates"><li><a href="http://media.ito.com/kevinmarks/dvorak.mp4" rel="enclosure alternate" type="video/mp4">iPod compatible MPEG-4 version, using H264 codec - requires QuickTime 7, iTunes 6 or VLC 0.84</a></li><li><a href="http://media.ito.com/kevinmarks/dvorak1.mp4" rel="enclosure alternate" type="video/mp4">iPod compatible MPEG-4 version, using the previous MPEG4 codec - works in QuickTime 6 or earlier iTunes</a></li><li><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting/dvorak.mov?torrent" rel="enclosure alternate" type="application/x-bittorrent">Dave's compatible MOV version via BitTorrent - should play back to QuickTime 1.0 once you have downloaded it</a></li></ol><br /><p>Those of you playing close attention will notice I am using markup based on the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/alternates-brainstorming">microformat brainstorming</a> for expressing alternative versions of the same file.

  <span class="p-name">Walukiewicz's Law</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  When I joined the BBC in 1988, my first direct manager was Ian Walukiewicz. When I expressed my frustration with management or colleagues to him, he explained it by a very simple principle.<br />People take jobs to improve themselves. They pick things that are hard for them. So, if you hate people you go into personnel, if you are chronically disorganised you go into management, and if you break everything you touch you become an engineer.<br /><a href="http://www.powazek.com/2006/06/000593.html">Derek Powazek</a> and <a href="http://media.odeo.com/2/0/5/The_Perfect_Apostrophe.mp3">Merlin Mann</a> discuss how they suffer and work extra hard at writing and being organised, respectively.<br />Which makes me wonder what things I am doing because I am bad at them. I've always been told that I'm completely useless at small talk and meeting new people, so the fact that I went to 4 public events last week and have 5 more lined up this week should be a big hint as to the character flaw I'm trying to fix.<br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Barcamp" rel="tag">Barcamp</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/BBC" rel="tag">BBC</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/BloggerCon" rel="tag">BloggerCon</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/mashpit" rel="tag">mashpit</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/microformats" rel="tag">microformats</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Robogames" rel="tag">Robogames</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/social" rel="tag">social</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Supernova" rel="tag">Supernova</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/where" rel="tag">where</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Open formats revisited</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/16/juggling-oranges">Mark Pilgrim has a thorough post explaining his move to open formats.</a> If you care about preserving your data, you should go and read it. On one small point I may be able to give some advice. Mark said:</p><blockquote><p>[I spent] Years of creating content, most recently video content in iMovie. Home movies of my children being born and growing up, heavily edited and burned to DVD and distributed to friends and family. Plus a few screencasts and some other odd video projects I&#8217;ve never released. Years of tagging and organizing an ever-growing collection of music, photos, and multimedia. I&#8217;ve now exported all my home movies as .DV files &#8212; one for the final product, one for all the unused clips. All other edits are lost. All editability is lost.</p></blockquote><br /><p>Mark, have a look at the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/">QuickTime format</a>. It is published and open, has been substantially the same for 15 years, and iMovie (finally) stores it's edit lists in it.</p><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/formats" rel="tag">formats</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Scoble eschews PR</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>When I dropped by Vloggercon on Sunday, I ran into Scoble and Furrier in the lobby, and said hello. They mentioned that they now realised they didn't need a press release. This matches what we do at Technorati - we just blog things ourselves. The press can find them.</p><a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/06/14/why-wall-street-didnt-believe-steve-ballmer-and-what-he-can-do-about-it/">Scoble puts it this way</a>:<br /><blockquote><p>I talked with the grassroots FIRST.

I almost bought into it too. In fact, I did. On Saturday I talked with maybe 20 people and said "can you wait until Tuesday to talk about it?" I wanted to give the story to the Wall Street Journal too. Not to mention I wanted to tell my coworkers before the story hit. I didn't get that chance and I'm lucky, in hindsight, that I didn't.

  <span class="p-name">The BPI gets tangled in DRM</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Just after the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2006/06/05/tech-savvy-mps-come-out-against-drm/">All-party Internet Group moved towards a sensible position on DRM</a>, the <a href="http://www.bpi.co.uk/index.asp?Page=news/press/news_content_file_1002.shtml">British Phonographic Industry gave confused testimony</a> to the Select Committee for Culture, Media &amp; Sport inquiry into New Media and the Creative Industries.</p><p>Obviously, the Record Labels' official lobbying group is going to be self serving, but they do seem very confused by DRM, judging by their headlines:</p><blockquote><ul><li>BPI reassures consumers: &#8220;We will not sue you for filling your iPod with music you have bought yourself"</li><li>Failure to extend copyright term "could turn an export into an import&#8221; - akin to scattering Britain's crown jewels of music across the globe. </li><li>BPI to sue illegal website AllofMP3.com</li><li>Digital downloads can cost more to distribute than CDs </li><li>BPI hopes to reach voluntary settlement on download royalties </li><li>Apple should make iTunes compatible with other players</li><li>Music &#8220;more popular than ever&#8221;</li></ul></blockquote><p>Let's group these together and deduce some consistent legislative proposals</p><blockquote><h4>BPI reassures consumers: &#8220;We will not sue you for filling your iPod with music you have bought yourself"</h4><p><cite>BPI Chairman Peter Jamieson</cite>: &#8220;We believe that we now need to make a clear and public distinction between copying for your own use and copying for dissemination to third parties and make it unequivocally clear to the consumer that if they copy their CDs for their own private use in order to move the music from format to format we will not pursue them.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Excellent, so lets have a law explicitly permitting non-commercial copying, and lets also make DRM technology that interferes with it illegal.</p><blockquote><h4>Apple should make iTunes compatible with other players</h4><p>Jamieson called on Apple to open up its software in order that it is compatible with other players. &#8220;We would advocate that Apple opts for interoperability,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote><p>Well, iTunes is actually pretty good at turning locked purchased files into uncompressed Audio CDs. That said, requiring them to distribute DRM-free files would solve this problem too. So nice to find a policy that satisfies all your points.</p><p>The next three are a bit of a conundrum, however</p><blockquote><h4>BPI to sue illegal website AllofMP3.com </h4><p> AllofMP3.com&#8217;s claims to be legal are false, she said. Neither artists nor record companies receive any payment from the site.</p><h4> BPI hopes to reach voluntary settlement on download royalties</h4><p>BPI Chairman Peter Jamieson revealed that the BPI, together with music download stores and mobile companies are still trying to reach an amicable settlement in their dispute with music publishers and songwriters over the royalties which must be paid on downloads.</p></blockquote><p>So, the BPI and AllOfMp3.com are both selling downloads that they don't have clear rights to? Tricky stuff. And yet:</p><blockquote><h4>Digital downloads can cost more to distribute than CDs </h4><br /><p>When questioned on the relative prices of CDs and downloads, Richardson revealed that for an independent company like his, the costs charged by digital distributors are actually higher than those for physical product.</p><p>Speaking later, he said, &#8220;It is early days for digital music. At this point in time the cost of distribution for downloads is actually higher than for CDs. Regardless of that, however, distribution remains a relatively small part of the investment record companies make in music. All of the key costs for a piece of music remain virtually the same whatever format you distribute it on.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This gets more confusing. Apple takes a small enough proportion of the price per song for the iTunes store that it has been accused of loss-leading them to sell iPods, and AllofMP3.com is just charging for bandwidth, so how are you running up these costs?</p><p>Clearly we need to find a way to separate paying for music from distributing it, as combining them, and trying to wrap them up in DRM is what is causing you such problems.</p><blockquote><h4>Failure to extend copyright term "could turn an export into an import&#8221; - akin to scattering Britain's crown jewels of music across the globe. </h4><p>&#8220;British music is one of Britain's greatest ambassadors, but failure to extend term could turn an export into an import,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we lose the Crown Jewels of British music, little money will flow back to the UK.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Ok, you've really lost me there. If the UK term is lower than foreign ones, as at present, then that is a great way to favour domestic production over imports - you can sell old foreign recordings in the UK with impunity, and you have 45 years more protection in the US so you can export your back catalogue there. Seems like a win-win for the UK public and economy, and suggests there would be a big benefit from shortening copyright terms in the UK further.</p><br /><blockquote><h4>Music &#8220;more popular than ever&#8221;</h4><p>Asked to summarise the position of UK record companies, Jamieson said, &#8220;Music has never been more popular. But it&#8217;s not time to break out the champagne just yet. Digital was always a threat and an opportunity, and I believe we are getting beyond the threat stage.</p><p>Richardson dismissed the idea that the internet somehow renders record companies redundant. Many of the oft-quoted examples of internet-built bands are simply an adaptation of long-established business methods. &#8220;Far from doing without record companies, they have used the internet to get themselves better deals with record companies,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote><p>So, music is more free, more available, more popular, and less subject to manipulation and domination by the labels. I think it is time to break out the champagne.</p><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/art " rel="tag">art </a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/audio" rel="tag">audio</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/BPIP" rel="tag">BPIP</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Digital Commonwealth" rel="tag">Digital Commonwealth</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/DRM" rel="tag">DRM</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/law" rel="tag">law</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/music" rel="tag">music</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Open Rights Group" rel="tag">Open Rights Group</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ORG" rel="tag">ORG</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/rhetoric" rel="tag">rhetoric</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Net Neutrality and copyright</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://scrawford.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/6/6/2010861.html">Susan Crawford is comparing the copyright debate with the net neutrality one</a>:<blockquote><p>I've been working steadily for quite a while on a paper comparing the IP battles to the network neutrality battle. As we've all discovered, these are very hard issues. There aren't clear answers, although the social benefits of the neutral-substrate internet (like the social benefits of the public domain) seem to be ignored by the people claiming the need for protection of their property rights.</p><p>It's finally becoming clear to me that the social argument is the only real argument. [...]</p><p>The key, though, is that neutrality (or unbundling, my preferred way of doing this) will be better for society as a whole. Awarding very strong property rights to the network providers, like awarding very strong property rights to content companies, won't be as beneficial to society as tempering those rights somewhat. We've done this in the IP context with things like fair use and "limited times" for copyright and patent protection. Indeed, the whole point of IP law is to encourage the creation of useful things for society; benefiting IP owners is a means towards that end.</p></blockquote><br /><p>Susan's underlying analogy has some promise, in that in both cases there are monopolies granted that create a kind of property right over a public good, or at least one with positive externalities. A while back I tried out multiple alternative arguments against <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005_08_01_epeus_archive.html#112483061228295429">copyright extension</a> and <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005_09_01_epeus_archive.html#112655528174520501">DRM</a>. Lets see how the copyright ones fit the net neutrality frame. These are the copyright arguments:</p><blockquote><dl><dt>Liberal collectivist</dt><dd>The shared culture of society should belong to the people together, not to faceless corporations.</dd><dt>Libertarian</dt><dd>Our ability to express ourselves freely should not be constrained by a state-granted monopoly.</dd><dt>Liberal Economist</dt><dd>As non-rivalrous goods with a vanishingly small marginal cost of reproduction, cultural goods reach maximum utility by being freely replicable.</dd><dt>Conservative</dt><dd>Creating property rights in goods that can be duplicated at will is inflationary, and undermines the value of real physical property that is the bedrock of a stable society.</dd></dl></blockquote><br /><p>Translating them into net neutrality we get:</p><dl><dt>Liberal collectivist</dt><dd>The infrastructure society needs to communicate should be controlled by the people together, not to faceless corporations.</dd><dt>Libertarian</dt><dd>Our ability to send data to each other freely should not be constrained by a state-granted monopoly.</dd><dt>Liberal Economist</dt><dd>The value of packets transferred is only clear to the originator and sender, not to the intermediary carrying them, so maximum utility is realised by enabling the endpoints to set values, not the network operator. </dd><dt>Conservative</dt><dd>Giving network operators the power to decide whose packets get priority undermines the traditional balance between family, government and other authorities that keeps society stable.</dd></dl><p>Doing this did make it clear that the argument is weaker in pure net neutrality terms. Emphasising the monopoly rights over public goods (cable-laying and radio spectrum rights) that they have used to build the networks may be better in this kind of argument.</p><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/copyright" rel="tag">copyright</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Digital Commonwealth" rel="tag">Digital Commonwealth</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/net neutrality" rel="tag">net neutrality</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Badgering the Beeb</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/30/sign_a_letter_suppor.html">Cory</a> and Rufus are encouraging us to sign an <a href="http://www.freeculture.org.uk/letters/CreativeArchiveLetter">Open Letter to the BBC</a>, badgering them about the Creative Archive. Something about its phrasing is a bit odd though. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, and then I thought about the curious love-hate relationship we have with the BBC in the UK, and I realised that they got the tone of sanctimony from the BBC itself.</p><p>Last week's Dr Who starred Maureen Lippman as a malign alien BBC announcer who steals souls through television, and she played it just right:</p><br /><object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B" width="640" height="368" codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab" ><param name="src" value="http://media.ito.com/kevinmarks/bbcwho.mov"><param name="autoplay" value="false"><param name="controller" value="true"><embed src="http://media.ito.com/kevinmarks/bbcwho.mov" width="640" height="368" autoplay="false" controller="true" pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"></embed></object><br /><p>This reminded me a lot of the goddess Media in <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/">Gaiman's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0380973650%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0380973650%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">American Gods</a>, though Neil was using a US TV archetype. The BBC has always wanted to set the cultural tone of the nation, and I don't think it is a coincidence that Orwell wrote 1984 after working there during the war. That episode makes the control of the faceless masses through TV explicit, but the Reithian attitude behind it is a familiar one.</p><p>However, it did set the cultural tone, certainly for my generation and before, and the tone was of a kind of shabby, well-read respectability, an Auntie knows best feeling, with a dash of 'lets put the show on right here' panto that let you know they weren't taking it too seriously. The old Dr Who was clearly made with an effects budget that wouldn't cover the hairdressers bill on a Hollywood film, but the willing suspension of disbelief made us complicit in this.</p><p>I grew up with the pips, the Shipping Forecast, Just a Minute, I'm Sorry I Haven't a clue and The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, with Playaway, The Clangers, Bagpuss and Ivor the Engine, with Dr Who, Top of the Pops, Fawlty Towers, Monty Python, Dads Army, Yes Minister and Blackadder. I'm proud of all these, and I am doing my best to share the best of them with my boys too.</p><p>I have been shaped by this culture too, I am involved, and I feel obliged to tell the BBC what to do in my own sanctimonious way. Having worked there, I know very well that the BBC is not a thinking entity, but a sprawling coalition of bickering bureaucracies that somehow manages to make great programmes despite it's internal regulations. But perhaps someone there can pick up on this and change things a little.</p><p>The BBC is bound by existing rights agreements, so it may not be able to distribute everything under a looser license as Rufus would like, but there are things it could do. Anything more than 50 years old is public domain, and could be released now, including all the Coronation footage used so well in that episode. Going forwards, new contracts can be drafted to enable public non-commercial use online, and I hope the BBC is considering this closely.</p><p>But the UK-only license is the sticking point. The BBC has gone down a wrong path here by expending significant resources to try an enforce territoriality online, blocking non-UK IP addresses, and locking up the content in Windows Media DRM to try to enforce a UK-only, one week duration public right through technological means.

  <span class="p-name">Building openness in - Pingerati and Microformat search</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Now we've <a href="http://technorati.com/weblog/2006/05/108.html">announced Pingerati and Microformat search</a>, I get a chance to reflect on what has been keeping me busy for the last month, and behind the hiatus in my writing here. I have been building a parallel infrastructure to our Blog indexing, focused on <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a> instead.</p><p><a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/search/microformats">Microformats</a> are a way of expressing common kinds of things we refer to online in HTML, such as people, places events and reviews. They are built on layers of open standards, and meant to re-use and converge existing ideas, not make up new ones out of thin air.</p><p>When <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/david+sifry">Dave</a> and I were building up <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/search/technorati">Technorati</a>, we were able to do so because of the underlying openness of the web environment - the infrastructure of the net itself, and the open source servers, databases and parsers we connect together to make the data flow.</p><p>We also built on a culture of openness that owes a lot to <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/dave+winer">Dave</a> <a href="http://scripting.com">Winer</a> - the openly accessible list of updated blogs gave a place to start in finding blogs to index, and by feeding back links to bloggers we encouraged cross-blog conversations.</p><p>When we added tags to blogs we used the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag">rel-tag microformat</a> in conjunction with existing category conventions, and made sure the links were not proprietary, but under authors' control. Again, helping people make connections through open standards.<br />By being open, we let everyone's world grow.</p><p>Although we are seeing more Microformats in blogs every day, we know that they make sense in other places too, and we need a way to encourage people to experiment with them, and find how they can add value to the world. Indexing them and reflecting them back to writers, but building an open data flow that others can tap in enables much more.</p><p>So, for the last couple of weeks, I've been working on <a href="http://pingerati.net">Pingerati</a>, which is a way to route Microformats around. If you have pages with data to share, you can ping it. If you want to find who has Microformats, it will ping you. The protocol is <a href="http://pingerati.net/about">as simple as it could be</a>, and it should enable the kind of positive sum gains I was talking about yesterday.</p><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/blogs" rel="tag">blogs</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/emergence" rel="tag">emergence</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/HTML" rel="tag">HTML</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/microformat" rel="tag">microformat</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/microformats" rel="tag">microformats</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/search" rel="tag">search</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/tags" rel="tag">tags</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/technorati" rel="tag">technorati</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Web 2.0&#8480;" rel="tag">Web 2.0&#8480;</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Design for Living</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  At the <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/">Netsquared conference</a> yesterday, I had an interesting conversation with Tom Munnecke about his <a href="http://www.upliftacademy.org/wiki/index.php?title=Value_Network_Model">attempts to model processes with positive effects</a>. It brought together several threads I have been following recently - <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/web_20_service_mark_controvers.html">Tim O'Reilly's trademark brouhaha</a>, the process of trying to effect positive change through the <a href="http://openrightsgroup.org/">Open Rights Group</a>, <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/006800.html">Jeremy Zawodny's disappointment with nofollow</a>, Yochai Benkler's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0300110561%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0300110561%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Wealth of Networks</a> and Jaron Lanier's <a href="http://edge.org/3rd_culture/lanier06/lanier06_index.html">Digital Maoism</a>.<br />What all these disparate essays share is a view of the world as a positive sum game, and varying perspectives on how the rules, practices, laws and technologies interact to adjust people's behaviour. I'm not sure if there is an overarching theory here, but there are general tendencies that can be applied when designing laws, or choosing which rules to apply to your work.<br />The key one is the notion of a positive sum game - that what you are making needs to be designed to add value for all parties who use it, not to try to sequester the value for yourself. That way it can grow in a natural way, because all who use it amplify the value in the world. <br />I've been working on something that I think follows this precept, and I'll hopefully be able to release it soon. <br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/culture" rel="tag">culture</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/emergence" rel="tag">emergence</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/netsquared" rel="tag">netsquared</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Open Rights Group" rel="tag">Open Rights Group</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ORG" rel="tag">ORG</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Tim O'Reilly" rel="tag">Tim O'Reilly</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/web 2.0" rel="tag">web 2.0</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Web 2.0&#8480;" rel="tag">Web 2.0&#8480;</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/wikipedia" rel="tag">wikipedia</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2006/travel-time-maps/">A great set of maps of journey times from MySociety </a>, but what I'd really like to see is an animation of this over time, showing different services come and go, and the train time intervals pulse through. Part of the problem of public transport is the sawtooth shape of the isochrones because of what happens when you miss a train by a minute and have to wait half an hour.

  <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2006/05/30.html#a1047">Scott Rosenberg is at the D Conference</a>:<br /><blockquote>Gates talked in very broad terms about TV/Internet convergence and Microsoft's "IPTV" initiative. What, Kara Swisher asked, does that do to the broadcast model? Gates "It's gone. It was a hack. People want to watch what they want to watch."</blockquote><br />However, Gates' Windows Media DRM is also a hack, and one designed to stop people watching what they want.

  <span class="p-name">Apple is holding my data hostage</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  When my boys' videos started getting some interest via their podcast and the Make film festival, I got 2 emails in a row from Apple's mac.com service saying I was exceeding bandwidth limits, and then I was cut off.<br /><br />Back when I worked for Apple, they launched mac.com as a free service, and I bagged our family names in their namespace. The integration of iDisk into the OS made it a simple way to post files to the web, and I used it for both work-related sample code and personal bits and pieces.<br /><br />Later on, Apple did a bait and switch, and started charging for mac.com. I decided the cost wasn't too onerous, and we could keep the email addresses and the hosting. It costs $100 a year, and $10 for each extra email address, but the switching cost seemed high, as we have a lot of friends who use those email addresses, and the hosting integreation is handy.<br /><br />Later on, I kept getting 'your email account is full' crap, and pointed out that gmail offered 100 times as much storage for free, and they later relaxed the terms a bit.<br /><br />Then came this, from noreply@apple.com:<blockquote><br /><p>Dear .Mac Member,</p><br /><p>Please be aware that you have reached 100% of your .Mac data transfer quota for this two-week period and we have turned off external access to your site(s). Attempts to visit there will produce a page explaining that your site has gone over data transfer quota and the material requested cannot be displayed.</p><br /><p>You can still publish to your site(s), but you will not be able to view any changes on the Internet until your site is reactivated. Reactivation will happen on the 1st or 16th of the month, whichever comes first. To review your data transfer usage, click here. To increase your data transfer quota by purchasing additional storage space, click here.* For more information see Help.</p><br /></blockquote><br />I thought 'OK, I'll move my stuff to other hosting, and redirect my links' - but the iDisk 'Sites' folder is also disabled on my machine, so I can't get at my files to move them.<br /><br />So, if some of my posts here are missing movies or images, that's why. <br />Amazon's S3 service is looking interesting, both Google and Microsoft are preparing hosting services, and there are a plethora of video hosting sites like blip.tv.<br /><br />Apple's terms are uncompetitive, and <a href="http://help.apple.com/mac2/1/help/member/pgs2/mem_fmset_gen26.html">stopping me from accessing my own files until I pay</a> is a nasty kind of blackmail.<br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Apple" rel="tag">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/hosting" rel="tag">hosting</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/mac.com" rel="tag">mac.com</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/podcasting" rel="tag">podcasting</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/QuickTime" rel="tag">QuickTime</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">The Copyright Extension scam</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  In the UK, the copyright term on sound recordings is set at 50 years. It's been this way since 1911, but suddenly, with the <a href="http://gowers.openrightsgroup.org/?p=13">Gowers Review</a> coming up, there is an orchestrated attempt to get it extended. The record labels (who will get a huge windfall if this happens) have dug up <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4917550.stm">Cliff Richard to plead poverty:</a><blockquote><p>According to the singer, many musicians recording in the 1950s rely on their copyright payments as a pension.</p><p>"It seems terribly wrong that 50 years on they lose everything from it."</p></blockquote><br />Now, copyright is a tradeoff, whereby a monopoly of limited duration is granted to the creator to exploit the work, after which it passes to the public domain. The thrust of the record labels' campaign is that artists don't make enough money from these recordings to save for a pension. Letting the labels continue to pay them a tiny fraction of revenues for another 45 years, when the sunk costs were accounted for 50 years ago makes no sense at all.<br /><a href="http://www.louisbarfe.com/muscop.htm">Louis Barfe attacks them on these grounds:</a><blockquote><p>To extend the copyright period in sound recordings would make an already complacent industry even more unbearably smug, and give a clear signal that they can get exactly what they want if they whine loud enough. The losers will be the artists who continue to have their back catalogue sat on by the fat corporate arse of the record companies, the small record companies who have made available numerous archive recordings that have passed into the public domain (which would almost certainly not be made available any other way), and, of course, the general record-buying public. </p><p>I&#8217;m a reasonable man. Here&#8217;s a counter proposal: Record companies can have copyright for as long as they want, as long as they make their entire archives commercially available in some shape or form at a reasonable price. Until then, no sale.</p></blockquote><br /><p>However, this concedes too much. The labels are trying to have it both ways here. In a digital world, the back catalogue can be released by simply digitising the songs and putting them up for sale online. The investment needed is tiny, and certainly doesn't justify conceding any more monopoly rights.</p><p>The labels' traditional pitch to musicians is that they have huge advantages in marketing and publishing through their marketing and connections, their economies of scale and skilled professionalism, which justifies them keeping over 90% of revenue.</p> <p>If this is true, why are they so afraid of competition?</p><p>With 50-year-old recordings, the production has been done, and the distribution costs can be made tiny with online digital sales; even CD pressing is orders of magnitude cheaper than it was 15 years ago, let alone 50. If the recordings are set free, others can publish them, including the original musicians, and keep more of the revenue for themselves. After all <a href="http://magnatune.com/info/model">Magnatune pay a 50% royalty on Creative Commons licensed music</a>.</p><p>The question to ask the labels is, if copyright expires on a recording, will you cease to sell it, or will you just cease to pay royalties to the musicians?</p><p>Looking back 60 years, a big artist then was <a href="http://www.dvltrust.org.uk/">Vera Lynn</a> - and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=music&amp;field-keywords=vera%20lynn/ref=xs_ap_l_xgl/026-4646626-6986068">her recordings seem to be abundantly available in the UK</a>. </p><p>So, are the labels still paying her royalties? Or are they pocketing the money themselves? </p><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/2006" rel="tag">2006</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/copyright" rel="tag">copyright</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Digital Commonwealth" rel="tag">Digital Commonwealth</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/music" rel="tag">music</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Open Rights Group" rel="tag">Open Rights Group</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ORG" rel="tag">ORG</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/rhetoric" rel="tag">rhetoric</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">ABC's TV on demand sounds unattractive</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2006/04/10/exploding-tv-ka-bloom/">Jeff Jarvis</a> points to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114463202813921449.html?mod=djemalert">ABC's mooted online free shows</a>:<blockquote><p>On April 30, ABC will unveil a revamped Web site that will include a &#8220;theater&#8221; where people with broadband connections can watch free episodes of &#8220;Desperate Housewives,&#8221; &#8220;Lost&#8221; and other hit shows on their computers. Episodes will be available the morning after they air and will be archived so people can eventually view a whole season.</p><p>Episodes of the ABC shows &#8212; which can be paused, rewound and fast-forwarded &#8212; will contain commercial breaks that viewers can&#8217;t skip, making Disney hopeful it has figured out a way to turn the delivery of programs over the Web into a profit-generating business. Ten advertisers, including Ford Motor Co., Procter &#38; Gamble, Universal Pictures and Unilever, already have signed up.</p></blockquote><br />Well, it's nice to add another option, but this one is only attractive compared to classic over-the-air or 'live' cable broadcast. Let's do a comparison table:<br /><table class="columnar"><tr><th>Delivery</th><th>Cost</th><th>Time constraint</th><th>space constraint</th><th>pros and cons</th></tr><tr><td>Broadcast</td><td>Free</td><td>must watch live or VCR</td><td>On your TVs in the US</td><td>Commercials interrupt - mute and wait</td></tr><tr><td>Cable</td><td>Monthly fee</td><td>must watch live or VCR</td><td>On your TVs in the US</td><<td>Commercials interrupt it - mute and wait</td></tr><br /><tr><td>TiVo</td><td>Monthly fee for cable and for TiVo directory</td><td>Can watch when you like, though will delete itself unless you check it</td><td>On the TV with the TiVo, in the US</td><<td>Can fast-forward commercials; must subscribe or record in advance</td></tr><tr><td>New ABC Live</td><td>Monthly fee for broadband</td><td>Can watch when you like from 1 day after TV</td><td>On your computer with a net connection - US Only?</td><td>can't skip commercials</td></tr><tr><td>ABC on iTunes</td><td>Monthly fee for broadband; $1.99 per show with discounts for seasons</td><td>Can watch when you like from 1 day after TV, if you have a US credit card</td><td>On your computer with a net connection, don't need net connection after download; can transfer to iPod</td><td>no commercials; quality is not great</td></tr><tr><td>Bittorrent bootleg</td><td>Monthly fee for broadband</td><td>Can watch when you like from a few hours after TV, anywhere in the world</td><td>On your computer, don't need net connection after download; can transfer to iPod and other players; can make DVD with effort</td><td>Commercials edited out. Is of dubious legality.</td></tr><tr><td>DVD</td><td>Pay per series - prices vary</td><td>Can watch when you like from a few months after TV, region coded to annoy you</td><td> on your DVD player; On your computer, can transfer to other players with effort and semi-legal tools</td><td>Commercials edited out. Maybe extra features</td></tr></table><br />Overall, the options are awkward. I can see some interesting gaps there - if I could subscribe to DVDs by mail every fortnight or month, while the series is still airing, that would be attractive (much more attractive than US networks' scheduling, which seems designed to confuse and disappoint and lose the flow of plot).<br />The iTunes series subscription could be attractive, if it was closer to the quality you get from HD-ripped Bittorrent or DVD. <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/04/a_brief_followup_on_tv_distribution.shtml">Tom Coates was saying something similar</a> recently.<br /><br />The other missing piece follows on from my post about net video last week- what if the cable companies had a cache of shows for a while after airing, or let you retrieve them from each others' PVRs? As the smarter ones have very high speed networks in their served neigbourhoods, this could be very responsive.<br /><br />Update: Well, that was fast - <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1024_3-6059444.html">Time Warner Cable are talking about just this kind of thing</a>, though<br />the closing line "TV is more powerful than the Internet at the end of the day" is a bit of a shame.<br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ABC" rel="tag">ABC</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/bittorrent" rel="tag">bittorrent</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Live TV is Dead" rel="tag">Live TV is Dead</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/movie" rel="tag">movie</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/podcasting" rel="tag">podcasting</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/QuickTime" rel="tag">QuickTime</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/streaming" rel="tag">streaming</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/television" rel="tag">television</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Patent Trolls</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I broadly agree with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html">Paul Graham's essay on Software Patents</a>, but I do think he underestimates the damage from patent trolls, and from what he calls the mafia-like behaviour of some patent holders.<br /><p>Paul has been lucky in the field he has worked in, but in the Audio and Video area there are many patent thickets. Perhaps it is the <a href="http://www.farnovision.com/chronicles/tfc-intro.html">history of Farnsworth's victory over RCA</a> that makes video engineers patent hungry.<br /><p>My first startup, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970605012728/www.mmcorp.com">The MultiMedia Corporation</a>, was a spin-out from the BBC in 1990. One of our products was a program called <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1563/is_n7_v9/ai_10868184">MediaMaker</a> that combined video from tape or videodisc, CD Audio, Pictures, digitised audio and Director animations into picture icons on a timeline for making presentations. It was demoed on stage at Macworld by the CEO of Apple, and we got Macromind to publish it.<br /><p>Then the patent troll showed up. A company called Montage had made a video editing system that included several video monitors showing edit points from tape. The company had gone out of business but a lawyer had bought up the patents, including one on using a still image to represent a video sequence. The troll was working his way round the video companies, and he caused enough trouble to stop work on the product while we worked on a legal defence instead.<br /><p>Later, while I was at Apple on QuickTime, there was a steady stream of patent trolls claiming that Apple should pay them royalties; enough to keep several lawyers busy, and a lot of engineers spending time working on prior art evidence demonstrations. <br /><p>Several potential features were excluded from QuickTime due to patent thickets. The obvious one was the Unisys LZW patent that encumbered GIF, but there were other more subtle pressures that meant adopting open source codecs was discouraged. Working on the patent license agreements for MPEG meant that <a href="http://news.com.com/Apple+spurns+proposed+MPEG-4+licenses/2100-1023_3-835740.html">technology ready to ship was deferred pending legal agreement</a> on more than one occasion.<br /><p>So I'm much lass sanguine than Paul about this. I think software patents should not be granted, and the <a href="http://openrightsgroup.org/orgwiki/index.php/Software_Patents">European Union's banning of them</a> is the right decision. I hope the <a href="http://gowers.openrightsgroup.org/">Gowers Review</a> in the UK makes this UK law as well.

  <span class="p-name">Video on the net is a solved problem, many times over</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  So why are <a href="http://news.com.com/2102-1034_3-6052986.html?tag=st.util.print">AT&amp;T and Verizon</a> arguing they need special legal exemptions to build an internet for video? This article is buried in misconceptions so deep, it's hard to know where to start. The basic argument is that in order to provide streaming movies over the internet, they need to build a dedicated connection between content companies and viewers. This is demonstrably false on several levels.<br /><br />First of all, <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_epeus_archive.html#113657665445571085">streaming is pointless</a> - it's applying the TV model to the net, which doesn't fit. The only reason to stream video is if it is live and two-way - an audio or video chat, an interactive game, or a conference with backchannel. In those cases, you can perceive lag between the ends, and you need latency kept low enough - well under a second for the first two, around 10-15 seconds for the third. We can do this over the public internet today, using Skype, iChat AV and <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/broadcaster/">QuickTime Broadcaster</a> (among others - I worked on the last two, so you can excuse me mentioning them).<br /><br />But you don't need low latency for movies. <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime">QuickTime</a> has been using plain webservers to serve video for 10 years, very sucessfully. In fact, <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> have built a very successful movie business over a content delivery network with very high latency, called the US Post Office.<br /><br />If you do want to deliver movies over the net, and they get popular, your servers and your upload connection may get overloaded (especially if you are an individual user that the telcos have sold an Asymmetric DSL line instead of the fibre to the home <a href="http://www.newnetworks.com/ShortSCANDALSummary.htm">they promised us 10 years ago</a> in their last bout of special pleading).<br /><br />Fortunately there are hosting companies that will cache it for you in their datacenters, like <a href="http://technorati.com/pop/youtube/">youtube</a> or <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/att.mov">mac.com</a>. If your movie gets really popular, what helps is distributed caches, closer to the people downloading. <a href="http://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a> run a service that offers this to companies with lots of money - Apple use it for their <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">high definition trailers</a>.<br /><br />If you can't afford that, don't worry, we've solved that one too - <a href="http://bittorrent.org/">Bittorrent</a> provides a way for everyone downloading the movie to act as a cache for each other, so you only need a single server seeding them all - <a href="http://www.prodigem.com/">Prodigem</a> makes this nice and easy.<br /><br />So, none of this needs special new 'dedicated pipes', or a VPN. They <a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/rants/Networkdynamics.html">lost that argument before with ISDN and reserved bandwidth</a> - it was a bad idea then, and it still is, but apparently telcos can't let go of the circuit switched model, even when their circuits have all been replaced by internet protocol.<br /><br />What makes all these choices for sending video over the net possible is precisely the content-independent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end to end</a> <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/">principle</a> that the telcos want to throw out so they can privilege their 'dedicated pipes' of packets over ours. Their argument is a tottering inverted pyramid of bullshit, and they need to be called on it publicly.<br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/bittorrent" rel="tag">bittorrent</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/f2c" rel="tag">f2c</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Live TV is Dead" rel="tag">Live TV is Dead</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/podcasting" rel="tag">podcasting</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/QuickTime" rel="tag">QuickTime</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/streaming" rel="tag">streaming</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/television" rel="tag">television</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Evolved Economics</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc's</a> post on <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/04/doc_searls_business_as_moralit.html">Nat's</a> blog <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/04/doc_searls_business_as_moralit.html">about morality</a>:<blockquote>We can approach everything through one of three moral systems:<br /><dl><dt>Morality of self-interest</dt><dd>This gives us "owning", "domination", etc. The Old School. Industrial Age shit. Still prevails in many business plans that are just for killing other companies.</dd><dt>Morality of accounting</dt><dd>We balance everything. "Paying debts", "owing favors". This is our system of justice, by the way. It's all about accounting. (Note the scales of justice symbol.)</dd><dt>Morality of generosity</dt><dd>We give. We are open. We love without expectation of reward, or even accounting. (In fact, when you bring in accounting, you compromise it.) Think about how we give to our spouses, our children, without strings. It pays off, too. But that's fundamentally not what it's about.</dd></dl></blockquote><br />This reminded me of a passage in Steven Pinker's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0142003344%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0142003344%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">The Blank Slate</a>:<blockquote><p>The anthropologist Alan Fiske has surveyed the ethnographic literature and found that virtually all human transactions fall into four patterns, each with a distinctive psychology. The first is <b>Communal Sharing</b>: groups of people, such as the members of a family, share things without keeping track of who gets what. The second is <b>Authority Ranking</b>: dominant people confiscate what they want from lower-ranking ones. But the other two types of transaction are defined by exchanges.</p><p>The most common kind of exchange is what Fiske calls <b>Equality Matching</b>. Two people exchange goods or favours at different times, and the traded items are identical or at least highly similar or easily comparable. The trading partners assess their debts by simple addition or subtraction and are satisfied when the favours even out. The partners feel the exchange binds them in a relationship, and often people will consummate exchanges just to maintain it. For example, in the trading rings of the Pacific Islands, gifts circulate from chief to chief, and he original giver may eventually get his gift back. (Many Americans suspect this is what happens to Christmas fruitcakes). When someone violates an Equality Matching relationship by taking a benefit without returning it in kind, the other party feels cheated and may retaliate aggressively. Equality Matching is the only mechanism of trade in most hunter-gatherer societies. Fiske notes that it is supported by a mental model of tit-for-tat reciprocity, and Leda Cosmides and John Tooby have shown that this way of thinking comes easily to Americans as well. It appears to be the core of our intuitive economics.</p><p>Fiske contrasts Equality Matching with a very different system called <b>Market Pricing</b>, the system of rents, prices, wages and interest rates that underlies modern economics. Market Pricing relies on the mathematics of multiplication, division, fractions and large numbers, together with the social institutions of money, credit, written contracts and complex division of labour. Market Pricing is absent in hunter-gatherer societies, and we know it played no role in our evolutionary history because it relies on technologies like writing, money and formal mathematics which appeared only recently.[...]</p><p>When people have different ideas about which of these four modes of interaction applies to a current relationship, the result can range from blank incomprehension to acute discomfort or outright hostility. Think about a dinner guest offering to pay her host for the meal, a person barking an order to a friend, or an employee helping himself to a shrimp off the boss's plate. Misunderstandings in which one person thinks of a transaction in terms of Equality Matching and another thinks in terms of Market Pricing are even more pervasive and can be even more dangerous. They tap into very different psychologies, one of the intuitive and universal, the other rarefied and learned, and clashes between them have been common in recent economic history</p></blockquote><br />David Weinberger, in his speech at F2C today, referred to the spurious appeal to fairness made by publishers of cultural goods, that the creator should be paid for any benefit received from a cultural good. This is stated at more length in <a href="http://openrightsgroup.org/orgwiki/index.php/Fair_but_Wrong">Fair but Wrong</a>.<br />Which brings me back to DRM - <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=999">Ed Felten notes</a> that Korean music publishers have quantified DRM's value destruction at 40%, which is more than the iTunes differential from CDs, though there the <a href="http://mamamusings.net/archives/2006/04/02/time_is_money_friend.php">convenience factor is worth something</a> too, though the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-movielink3apr03,1,5452250.story?track=rss">downloadable movies at twice the price of DVDs scheme</a> is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/boingboing/iBag?m=496">sure to fail</a>.<br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/DRM" rel="tag">DRM</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/education" rel="tag">education</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ethics" rel="tag">ethics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/f2c" rel="tag">f2c</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/iPod" rel="tag">iPod</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/law" rel="tag">law</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/movie" rel="tag">movie</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Open Rights Group" rel="tag">Open Rights Group</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/rhetoric" rel="tag">rhetoric</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Unexpected agreement?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I've been saying for a while that the left/right split is often irrelevant to the politics around the net; it is much more about freedom and control, about trusting the public en masse or fearing them.<br />I have two illustrations of agreement across political lines tonight. First, <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">danah boyd</a> and Bill O'Reilly of Fox News in <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=0Nfyw2KYHWw">striking agreement over myspace</a>.<br /><br />Secondly, <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2006/03/marx-is-backget-used-to-it.html">Tara Hunt's Marx-citing</a> on marketing:<blockquote>But re-reading the Communist Manifesto, I was, once again, swept up in the following passage:<br /><blockquote>When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. [...]</blockquote><br />THE COMMONS WILL OWN THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND WILL CALL THE SHOTS. I don't know about you, but that sounds pretty rockin' to me. But then again, I have faith in human beings.</blockquote><br />aligns with <a href="http://marksteyn.com/">Mark Steyn</a> and <a href="http://instapundit.com/">Glen Reynolds</a> as cited in <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/article.jsp?content=20060403_124174_124174">Steyn's review of Army of Davids</a>:<blockquote>The professor thinks we're in a transformative moment: "the triumph of personal technology over mass technology. . . . Starting around 1700, big organizations became the most efficient way to do a lot of things," he writes. But today, "economies of scope and scale" no longer favour the big, and those organizations that don't get it are like the old joke about the Pravda headline boasting that the Soviet Union made the biggest microchip in the world. "The empowerment of individuals," says Reynolds, "may lead to an interesting twist on Karl Marx's goal: workers control the means of production, all right, but it's a far cry from Communism."<br /><br />That rang a vague bell with me and, after rootling through my mouldering clippings, I found an old column of mine from five years ago -- before Reynolds had started Instapundit or I'd even heard of "blogs." "We have arrived at the situation Marx and Engels urged upon us, in which the proletariat would rise up and seize control of the means of production," I wrote. "Their only mistake was that they were envisioning a workers committee running the local steel mill. But the steel mills have gone, and today the biggest industry in the United States is entertainment. That's the one the masses are kicking down the factory gates of."</blockquote><br />It's not just media.

  <span class="p-name">AjaxWrite - a huge missed opportunity</span>

  So Michael Robertson has introduced <a href="http://www.ajaxwrite.com/">AjaxWrite</a> as a web-based word-processor. Nice idea, except what formats does it save to? <br />MS Word, RTF, Text and PDF.<br />How about HTML+CSS - it's how you're displaying the damn thing to me after all - how hard is it to store it in that format?<br />This is not <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/microsoft_word_20_years_and_st_1.html">a new question</a> - after all CSS is more capable than Word's internal styling.<br />How about a Document Microformat?

  <span class="p-name">Deal or No Deal</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2006/001236.html">David Hornik wrote a post</a> comparing VC and buyouts to the TV show <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Deal_or_No_Deal/">Deal or No Deal</a>.<br /><br />Now, my sons like watching this show, and I don't mind as it is a great lesson in probability. The expected value is pretty easy to calculate (sum of remaining amounts divided by number of remaining suitcases), so you have an objective valuation to compare the banker's offer against. Doing the calculation in your head isn't that hard, as you only need to sum up the top few amounts &#8212; lower ones don't significantly affect the outcome. The offers from the banker are consistently below the actual expected value, until they get down to a small number of cases. <br /><br />At it's core, this program is in the same <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005_01_01_epeus_archive.html#110483498938583671">Greek God model of reality TV I have discussed before</a>; unlike "Who Wants to be a Millionaire", which has a skill element alongside the "stop or continue" calculation, it is playing on the fact that knowledge of probability is not something that has been evolutionarily selected for, and thus needs to be painstakingly learned (if you doubt this, look at the city that probability built, Las Vegas). This reveals itself in Howie Mandel saying flagrantly untrue things like "there is a good chance you have a million dollars in your case" when there are 20 left, and so the chance is 5%, and indeed in the way the producers seem to be trying hard to get someone to win a million (which is hugely unlikely given the game's form, as when you are left with 2 cases, the buyout offer is very easy to calculate) - to the point where they are adding in cases with $2 million and $3 million in.<br /><br />So how does this fit with Hornik's analogy? One thing that is clear is that if there isn't an objective way to value what you have, it helps if there is more than one banker to make you offers. If it is just Google, Yahoo or Microsoft, then the entrepreneurs may be in a take it or leave it situation, but if there are competing bidders, they have a better chance. It is this that makes sense of the <a href="http://www.valleywag.com/tech/acquicor/acquicor-hat-seeks-cattle-161266.php">otherwise inexplicable flotation of a public company of ex-Apple execs</a> with no products or services, who want to buy up companies using IP.<br /><br />PS If you look at <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Casting/Applications/DOND_Long_Application.pdf">the Deal or No Deal application form</a>, it makes it very clear that watching you and your family and friends agonise over the decisions is the whole point of the show, and interestingly, alongside questions about criminal convictions also asks:<blockquote><br /><p>Have you ever created a website or posted any materials on any website? YES NO (Circle One) If YES, describe the website(s) you created and/or the materials you posted.</p><br /><p> Have you appeared in any magazines, publicly disseminated photographs, advertisements or the Internet?</p><br /></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/television" rel="tag">television</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/VC" rel="tag">VC</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Venture Capital" rel="tag">Venture Capital</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Microformats and Microsoft</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://microformats.org/blog/2006/03/20/bill-gates-at-mix06-we-need-microformats/">Bill Gates endorsed Microformats</a> at Mix '06 yesterday. Here's the clip in <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/mix06mf.asx">Windows Media format</a>, and <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/mix06mf.mov" rel="enclosure">QuickTime format</a> (thanks <a href="http://suda.co.uk/">Brian</a>).<br /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2006/03-20MIX.asp">Transcript</a>:<blockquote><p><cite>BILL GATES:</cite>Everything we do here has to be incredibly flexible, because you're going to be doing your own sites, you might want things that are specific to your industry that, of course, Microsoft isn't going to have those things, so you need total flexibility because you're addressing all the different layers of the stack there.</p><p>And so all the interoperability standards here, whether it was XML to start with that we were a key part of giving that out as a standard, then the SOAP-level stuff, now we've moved up to a variety of techniques including Web services, all of those things are out there and free for people to use. Even the recent stuff that Ray has done about the simple list extensions, Live Clipboard, that's connecting up to everyone.</p><p><cite>TIM O'REILLY:</cite> That's true, that stuff really wowed people when he demoed it at our e-Tech Conference. I thought, you know, this whole idea of the semantic Web is actually starting to happen in small ways with microformats, and I thought the fact that Ray picked up on that was really nice, he got a really great response from the geeks who were my audience.</p><p><cite>BILL GATES:</cite> Well, I think his analogy that we've been exchanging data and had some standard formats within a machine, that he now would take that to, okay, let's exchange between different Web sites, it's going to take the idea of contact cards, scheduled appointments, set of directions, all these things where we move standard schema, we need microformats that people agree on, it's going to let that bootstrap. Because the more those things become standard, the more other Web sites choose them, and therefore the more popular they become.</p><p><cite>TIM O'REILLY:</cite> Right, so that you get the network effects that really allow us to weave applications together.</p><p><cite>BILL GATES:</cite> Right. And it's all very market driven. If some format is too rigid, then nobody is locked into that, somebody can come along and do something completely different.</p></blockquote><br />It's great to see the work we've been doing on Microformats being picked up. Here's me telling Ray Ozzie about them less than a year ago: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/scsray.asx">Windows Media format</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Bill Gates" rel="tag">Bill Gates</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/microformats" rel="tag">microformats</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/microsoft" rel="tag">microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Mix06" rel="tag">Mix06</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Tim O'Reilly" rel="tag">Tim O'Reilly</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/web 2.0" rel="tag">web 2.0</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

She'd never figured out why this lovely burst of creativity had happened in Bangkok. With AIDS still methodically eating its way into the vast carcass of Asia, Bangkok certainly wasn't happier than most other places. Apparently the late 2020s had just somehow been Bangkok's global moment to shine. It was genuinely happy music, bright, clever music, like a gift tooth world.

The packets get routed, but the protocols are designed to cope with messiness, with buffers overflowing, and computers crashing, and wires being unplugged or ripped up by backhoes. This is the mental model the end-to-end principle encourages - the net is just where packets come from and go to, and has a big '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEP_field">Somebody Else's Problem' field</a> around it. This is one place where engineers and normal people converge - they don't think about how stuff gets there, they just enter a website or email or IM address and there they are.<br /><img alt="Internet thought balloon" height="192" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7cAS_dEul22MlEtRFhabkc0a2c/cloud2.png" style="float:right;" width="256"/>By contrast, telco's and networking providers, naturally, do see the wires and the complexity, because that's what they do. They can't use the SEP method, so they fall back on thinking hierarchically, which is another way of coping with complexity. This contributes to the difficulty of getting the open network argument across to governments - the hierarchic frame is a good fit for <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_11_01_epeus_archive.html#106812371392494147">their default approach to organisation</a> and information flow, so regulatory capture is a likely outcome. <br />There are countervailing ideas in political thought across the political spectrum, from commons theory to anti-trust and deregulation. The immense success of WiFi's tiny slice of free spectrum is promising, but as <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/02/27#ourSpace">Doc</a>, <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=266">Eric</a> and <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Ratcliffe/?p=91">Mitch</a> and <a href="http://www.weblogsky.com/archives/000816.html">Jon</a> point out, the attack on net neutrality is building.

  <span class="p-name">Internet regeneration</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>The internet is up for debate again. I'd like to connect the thoughts of 3 smart women and one dead white male.</p><p>What I see is a generational divide - there is my generation, who built the internet; the protocols, the applications and are filling it with our thoughts and ramblings. For this generation, I'd claim Douglas Adams, whose <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html">1999 essay</a> I keep returning to. Do go read the whole thing; I'm going to cite a small part of it today:</p><blockquote><p>we are still the first generation of users, and for all that we may have invented the net, we still don't really get it. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0060958332%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0060958332%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">The Language Instinct</a>, Stephen Pinker explains the generational difference between pidgin and creole languages. A pidgin language is what you get when you put together a bunch of people &#8212; typically slaves &#8212; who have already grown up with their own language but don't know each others'. They manage to cobble together a rough and ready lingo made up of bits of each. It lets them get on with things, but has almost no grammatical structure at all.</p><p>However, the first generation of children born to the community takes these fractured lumps of language and transforms them into something new, with a rich and organic grammar and vocabulary, which is what we call a Creole. Grammar is just a natural function of children's brains, and they apply it to whatever they find.</p><p>The same thing is happening in communication technology. Most of us are stumbling along in a kind of pidgin version of it, squinting myopically at things the size of fridges on our desks, not quite understanding where email goes, and cursing at the beeps of mobile phones. Our children, however, are doing something completely different.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts">danah boyd</a> has been <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/AAAS2006.html"> talking to our children, the MySpace generation</a>, who have grown up with pervasive networking, and are making it their own place, a parallel world interwoven into their real-world lives:</p><blockquote><p>What we're seeing right now is a cultural shift due to the introduction of a new medium and the emergence of greater restrictions on youth mobility and access. The long-term implications of this are unclear. Regardless of what will come, youth are doing what they've always done - repurposing new mediums in order to learn about social culture.</p><p>Technology will have an effect because the underlying architecture and the opportunities afforded are fundamentally different. But youth will continue to work out identity issues, hang out and create spaces that are their own, regardless of what technologies are available.</p></blockquote><br /><a href="http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog">Suw Charman</a>, of the <a href="http://openrightsgroup.org/">Open Rights Group</a>, spoke<a href="http://www.rsa.org.uk/events/detail.asp?eventID=1791"> at the RSA on the internet golden age</a> this week (there is <a href="http://www.thersa.org/audio/lecture230206.mp3" rel="enclosure">a full mp3 recording of the debate</a>). I'm extracting Suw's conclusion:<br /><blockquote><object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B" width="320" height="16" codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab"<param name="src" value="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/hope.mov"><param name="autoplay" value="false"><param name="controller" value="true"><embed src="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/hope.mov" width="320" height="16" autoplay="false" controller="true" pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"></embed></object><p>Our hope is in teenagers, because they have grown up with the internet in a way that none of us have. For them this is all second nature - they will route round the damage that is done, but we have to make sure there is not too much damage for them to try and heal.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://scrawford.blogware.com/blog">Susan Crawford</a>, of <a href="http://onewebday.org/">OneWebDay</a>, wrote a <a href="http://scrawford.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/2/24/1781417.html">discussion of framing</a> that talks of the founding fathers who say the Internet is a collection of standards that allow the networking of computers, the users who say the Internet is the collection of interactions and relationships that happen online, and contrasts them with the telcos who say that "the Internet" is about cables and connections that they charge for.</p><p>This leads us to a different generation, the politicians and incumbent executives who have prospered in a narrow culture of favours exchanged behind closed doors, of regulatory creation of monopoly rents, and who look at the next two generations with fear. It is up to us to make sure that the dynamic spontaneous orders that are continually being created with the Internet's help are not choked off by a backlash from the old order.</p><p>My generation draws the Internet as a cloud that connects everyone; the younger generation experiences it as oxygen that supports their digital lives. The old generation sees this as a poisonous gas that has leaked out of their pipes, and they want to seal it up again. This is why we need to fight for our <a href="http://www.ertnet.demon.co.uk/2kinds.html">spontaneous orders</a>. </p><p>Ultimately, I believe the our more open way will succeed through it's very creative, positive-sum nature, but that does not mean we should complacently stand by.</p><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/caliban" rel="tag">caliban</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Digital Commonwealth" rel="tag">Digital Commonwealth</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ethics" rel="tag">ethics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Open Rights Group" rel="tag">Open Rights Group</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ORG" rel="tag">ORG</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/rhetoric" rel="tag">rhetoric</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">UK Parliament DRM hearing today - too many calls to replace jurisprudence by software</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  The APIG inquiry into DRM had it's public hearing today.<br />Suw Charman, as well as presenting for the Open Rights Group, also <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2006/02/02/apig-drm-public-inquiry-hearing/">took phenomenally extensive notes</a><br />A few selected quotes, focused on the '<a href="http://www.code-is-law.org/">code as law</a>' and '<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.06/view_pr.html">missing leeway</a>' aspects of DRM:<br /><h4>From <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/orgwiki/index.php/APIG_DRM_Public_Inquiry_KevinMarks_Submission">my previous submission</a>:</h4><br /><blockquote><br /><p>The second principle is the core one of jurisprudence - that due process is a requirement before punishment. I know the Prime Minister has defended devolving summary justice to police constables, but the DRM proponents want to devolve it to computers. The fine details of copyright law have been debated and redefined for centuries, yet the DRM advocates assert that the same computers you wouldn't trust to check your grammar can somehow substitute for the entire legal system in determining and enforcing copyright law.</p><br /><p>Each computers' immanent ability to become any kind of machine and the copying of data that happens as part of this, leads the DRM advocates naturally to the point where they want to outlaw computers, or to take them over by stealth, using virus-like techniques.</p><br /><p>The reductio ad absurdum of this is to privilege DRM implementers in law above the owners of the computers on which their software runs, without their effective consent. Sadly, this is exactly what is being demanded by the publishers' lobby.</p><br /></blockquote><br /><h4>Suw for ORG:</h4><br /><blockquote><br /><p>DRM over-enforces the law. It reaches beyond the copy restrictions enshrined in copyright law; restricts fair and legitimate uses of legally acquired materials; and sometimes revokes or reduces &#8216;rights&#8217; after purchase. It destroys the balance between private interest and public good and damages the public shared culture in our libraries.</p><br /><p>DRM limits consumer&#8217;s ability to enjoy legitimately purchased materials and punishes behaviour seen by the majority as normal. The industry&#8217;s pushes towards more restrictive legislation will serve to do nothing more than criminalise more people. Yet the lawsuits which will clog the courts will do nothing to change people&#8217;s behaviour, because they believe what they are doing is fair and reasonable.</p><br /></blockquote><br /><h4>PACT:</h4><br /><blockquote><br /><p>Q: If the public understood that DRM was to manage piracy, maybe they&#8217;d understand, but they see it as restricting private use. How do you reconcile that?</p><br /><p> A: Balance between what people perceive they are entitled to do, and what they actually are. In the past, rights holders have ignored some usage, because it didn&#8217;t harm them. But with digital technology, it is damaging, and a new contract needs to be reached with the consumer so they understand what they can and can&#8217;t do.</p><br /></blockquote><br />This explicitly states the 'we get to decide what the law is' problem of DRM enforcement.<br /><h4>Simon Wheeler (Beggars Banquet):</h4><br /><blockquote><br /><p>As one of the only content owners at this session, we&#8217;ve had several licences with insecure businesses and our physical businesses has grown. We choose not to copy protect our CDs, in that we are trying to build trust with the audience, and build loyalty, and in return they respect our rights. Instead of trying to lock things down, which we don&#8217;t believe is acceptable, we are trying to go down the third way of building that trust. Companies that do try to lock down music on to CD, and the Sony-BMG rootkit is the most notorious example, and we think they are hurting the business as a whole. We have an obligation to deliver music to our users and consumers, and if we don&#8217;t make it available to them they will get it any way possible.</p><br /><p>There&#8217;s a wide range of opinions throughout the industry and sometimes what you&#8217;re hearing and seeing, the loudest voice, is not representative of the industry.</p><br /></blockquote><br /><h4>Audible:</h4><br /><blockquote><br /><p>Q: What happens if DRM comes under attack from consumers?</p><br /><p>A: We have a proprietary DRM system, we can set the rules, it&#8217;s very flexible. But it is fair to say that if we were in a position that we were not able to distribute content with DRM we would have no business.</p><br /></blockquote><br />Note who sets the rules (hint, it's not 300 years of common law precedent in copyright law).<br /><blockquote><br /><p>Q: Problem for libraries, is they need to get access after the DRM has become obsolete, and after copyright expired. Could you see a method enabling that?<br /></p><br /><p> A: If you&#8217;re a library, you want a database of everything that&#8217;s ever been recorded and there&#8217;s no reason why that can&#8217;t be made available to the publc. I would object, however, if they had all our books and made them available in the clear to the public.</p><br /></blockquote><br />Call me old-fashioned, but I thought that was the definition of a library.<br /><br /><blockquote><br /><p>Q: Your DRM helps the customer behave legally?</p> <p>A: Well there&#8217;s been some discussion that the consumers don&#8217;t understand what their legal rights are, and that there are accepted practices. Benefits of DRM is that it allow people to do what they are allowed to do and no more, so they don&#8217;t need to know what the law is.</p><br /></blockquote><br />Again, the assertion that a) copyright law has hard edges and b) that computers can enforce it. Remarkable.<br /><h4>Publishers Association, Periodical Publishers Association:<br /></h4><br /><blockquote><br /><p>Q: You can see why noninteroperabilties would be a commercial benefit to some parts of the chain. Is the driving force going to be interoperability?</p><br /><p>A: We share some views with the Open Rights Group. Suw highlighted the problems of some companies locking people into to some platforms, but then you made the point of what if the customer rejects this DRM by not buying. In a sense that is the solution. It&#8217;s proper that customers should be able to say &#8216;I don&#8217;t like this, I won&#8217;t buy it&#8217;. That&#8217;s a right that the customer has, and industry can create several business models and one will succeed.</p><br /><p>We are committed to interoperability and the key is open standards. As an industry we&#8217;re opposed to allowing any one tech interest to become a gatekeeper, who can impose themselves between us and our customers.</p><br /></blockquote><br /><h4>Louise Ferguson(?) consumer:</h4><br /><blockquote><br /><p>As more consumers, and we&#8217;re not just consumers, we are citizens who create our own content. Offcom recognises that consumers are creators, but all the systems we see at the moment deny this fact, and any approach to future policy should accept that we are not just passive consumers of corporate content.</p><br /></blockquote><br /><h4>FIPR - Ross Anderson:</h4><br /><blockquote><br /><p>Someone remarked that the industries [? indies] are getting more power, and I suspect this is because the indies have higher internal rate of return, because they are smaller, and this is more in line with artist aspirations, and this lines up with the public, selling for more money with more rights given to the consumer, rather than cheaper with less rights that the majors do.</p><br /><p>Q: What can we do with legislation?</p> <p>A: Revisit the contract terms legislation, because people have to sign EULAs. Also, look at fruit of the poisoned tree clauses, e.g. clause 42 of the patent act. So you could have a rule saying that you lose your legal protection if your DRM abuses people&#8217;s rights.</p><br /><p>That would be feasible under current framework.</p><br /></blockquote><br /><br />Now that would be a good restraint on the enforcement over-reach discussed above.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/orgwiki/index.php/APIG_DRM_Public_Inquiry">More information on previous submissions at the ORG wiki</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/copyright" rel="tag">copyright</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Digital Commonwealth" rel="tag">Digital Commonwealth</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/DRM" rel="tag">DRM</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/law" rel="tag">law</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Open Rights Group" rel="tag">Open Rights Group</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ORG" rel="tag">ORG</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  The British Government's Identity Card bill is returning to the Lords' this week, and The Times has a <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1052-1987493,00.html">Rees-Mogg editorial saying</a>:<blockquote>It seemed then that the internet might be a liberalising influence, giving the individual more power relative to the State. To an extent this proved true. [...]<br />Public fear of terrorism gave governments the support needed to tighten systems of social control and supervision. [...]<br />The British Government took advantage of this opportunity to impose new methods of control that could not have been put through Parliament in normal circumstances. In particular, the Home Office, under authoritarian Home Secretaries, introduced Bills that it had wanted for a long time. The whole balance between the citizen and the State was altered in favour of the State.[...]<br />In the history of Britain there have been many periods when liberty was threatened. The immediate threat is a government with a lust for control, with little respect for liberty or for the House of Commons, but enjoying the opportunity of using new technologies for social control.</blockquote><br />It is against this backdrop that the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/">Open Rights Group</a> was set up to campaign for digital liberty in the UK, and I am honoured to be part of its Advisory Council.<br /><br />If you want to join us in campaigning to keep computers and the net as tools of freedom and not coercion, you can <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/support-org/">sign up here</a>. <br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Open Rights Group" rel="tag">Open Rights Group</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ORG" rel="tag">ORG</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">How Apple lost it's Web Video mojo, and how it could get it back</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2006/tc20060109_432937.htm">Clayton Christensen is warning Apple</a> against repeating old mistakes, but they have made different mistakes in video before.<br />Between my accepting a job on QuickTime at Apple in 1997, and my visa coming through in April 1998, Apple launched QuickTime 3.<br />The long awaited fully cross-platform version, it brought full editability and extensible video playback to Windows, and was abstracted enough to run on other platforms (it had been demoed on Irix, Linux and Solaris - this underlying Mac OS compatibility layer is what became Carbon).<br />At the time QuickTime was installed on over 60% of Windows machines, Apple had won the Canyon lawsuit against Microsoft and Intel, and the new version was really good, bringing the full power of video editing by reference all those platforms.<br /><br />So how did they fuck up?<br /><br />They invented pop-up web ads, and put one in before playing any web QT movie to sell the 'Pro' version of the player. They crippled the QT Player to remove the editing features unless you paid - even for the Mac users who had had the benefit before.<br /><br />Their Windows installed base sank like a stone. Independent developers who were out getting QT installed on millions of Windows PCs stopped using it, as the pop-up ad would inevitably ruin their pitch demos, and corporations would not let it be installed. Not being party to the internal debate on this, I don't know who to blame for this debacle, but the hard drive of the machine I got when joining the QT Engineering team was called 'Fuck Phil Schiller'.<br /><br />By hiding their biggest differentiator - editability - from users, Apple ceded the battle for web audio and video formats (the distraction of Streaming didn't help either). When widespread audio and video sharing happened, MP3 won for audio and the bizarre MPEG-4 in AVI hack that was DiVX won for video, because they were simple, non-streaming files.<br /><br />When Apple added MP3 and MPEG4 support, they again had the chance to win users back, but they didn't make QT play back MPEG4 in AVI, despite being the default AVI player, and having all the needed codecs. This gave people another huge incentive to switch.<br /><br />Eventually, though, Apple realised that local storage beats streaming, and came up with iPod and iTunes to ride the MP3 wave. They got their file format adopted by MPEG4 and did a great job of licensing and implementing MPEG4 codecs.<br /><br />With the iPod Video, they have the chance to reclaim this ground. The no-config encoding of H264 looks very good, and they could reclaim the de facto format as .mp4 or .m4v. They picked up on Podcasting, and let anyone, even <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=111817969&amp;s=143441">my sons</a>, get into their directory. <br /><br />If they don't make more DRM mistakes, and enable users to share audio and video playlists based on what they have played, they could retake the initiative.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Apple" rel="tag">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/DRM" rel="tag">DRM</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Macworld" rel="tag">Macworld</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/movie" rel="tag">movie</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/podcasting" rel="tag">podcasting</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/QuickTime" rel="tag">QuickTime</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/television" rel="tag">television</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">DRM Groundhog Day</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Talking to <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/10/DRMprobs">Tim Bray</a> tonight, I realised I've been blogging about DRM for over four years now. Yet, the arguments recur.<br />I was going to write a post called 'Tyranny of the Storytellers' when I realised I had said it before <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2001_11_01_epeus_archive.html#7053068">in my first week of blogging</a><blockquote>Too often the best storyteller for a particular audience can win out over someone who is constrained to telling the truth. A current example is the DRM debacle. Any competent engineer knows that the notion of locking up content from those who purchase it and view it on their own computers is technically impossible (setting aside the moral bankruptcy for a minute). The 'content owners' so much want this to be true that they are creating a market for snake-oil that appears to give them what they dream of. Which I suppose is poetic justice of a sort.</blockquote><br />This was before I predicted <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_06_01_epeus_archive.html#85179071">class action lawsuits</a> and <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_07_01_epeus_archive.html#85265183">criminal prosecutions</a> against <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_01_01_epeus_archive.html#8616468">Audio CD DRM foolishness.</a><br />And so to this weeks iteration. <a href="http://www.lllj.net/blog/archives/2006/01/06/how-can-drm-be-good/">Lloyd Shepherd said</a><blockquote>let's face it: we're going to have to have some DRM. [...]it's clear that the people who make the consumer technology that ordinary people actually use - the Microsofts and Apples of the world - have already accepted and embraced this. The argument has already moved on.</blockquote><br /><a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/01/09#welcomeToTheLongRun">Doc responded:</a><blockquote>why the hell does Apple, Microsoft and other Bigs using DRM mean that it's good or that it's "won" a damn thing? Hey, they sucked up to Hollywood for distribution of mass-media Hollywood-type crap. And they're going to screw it up, too. You'll go to Google for your CBS, Apple for your NBC and Microsoft for your ABC. The old sources will be distributed through a mess of incompatible systems, each isolated by their own DRM, and will flush their costly, inefficient and ossified old industry into the hell we've had on the Net with instant messaging for the duration.</blockquote><br /><a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/2006/01/09/debate-on-drm/">Shelley returns with:</a><blockquote>by saying that "all DRM is evil" and that only recourse we have is to keep the Internet completely free, and only with independents will we win and we will win, oh yes we will&#8211;this not only disregards the actuality of what&#8217;s happening now, it also disregards that at times, DRM can be helpful for those not as well versed in internet technologies.</blockquote> (much more in her comments).<br /><a href="http://ceicher.homeunix.com/archives/2006/01/a_response_to_k.html">Also Charles Eicher replied</a> to my <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/orgwiki/index.php/APIG_DRM_Public_Inquiry_KevinMarks_Submission">APIG submission</a>.<br />His discussion of the Church-Turing thesis is one built on a rebuttal to the extended version of it put forth by Kurzweil and Wolfram to imply that the human brain and the universe are bound by universal computability. While these are fascinating ideas, I am talking about computers, and he concedes that "a computer is defined as a device that can run computer programs.", then handwaves about quantum computing, while misunderstanding that in order to view encrypted media, you need to decode it into a viewable form.<br />To this I respond "Eppur si muove" - emulation has been doing a fine job in preserving digital works, and will continue to do so, with Moore's law making it easier.<br />His 'DRM is fine in private contracts' argument would be reasonable were this what is being proposed, but it is not - the DMCA, Broadcast Flag and other proposed legislation privileges DRM with summary powers to limit fair use, and criminalise circumventing it. Many <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/boycottdrm">can and do reject DRM contracts</a>, which is why DRM proponents resort to <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/orgwiki/index.php?title=Sony_DRM">subterfuge</a> and laws attempting to restore the kind of monopoly control of publication the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne">Statute of Anne</a> abolished.<br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/copyright" rel="tag">copyright</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/DRM" rel="tag">DRM</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ORG" rel="tag">ORG</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Live TV is dead, and we're noticing the smell</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Doc <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/01/06#bv">notes the Viiv announcement</a> with trepidation, and also says:</p><blockquote>I've almost given up anyway. The other night in the hotel we watched Anderson Cooper, CNN's version of Geraldo Rivera (always On the Scene, always Concerned, always Talking With The People Involved), report for 45 minutes on word that nearly all the trapped miners in West Virginia were saved. In the morning we found out that the report was false. Not from the TV, but from a phone call and from bloggers deconstructing the whole mess.</blockquote><p>Live TV is dead. Last week I was waiting for my car to be serviced, (which took 2 hours longer than expected because of a recall), so I sat in a room with CNN on for 3 hours, hearing the 'live' announcers link to the same taped stories over and over again, using the same 'spontaneous asides' repeatedly. It made <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2133551/?nav=navoa">Dinner For One</a> look fresh and new.</p><p>I stopped watching Local TV news years ago - their endless teasing to tide you over the adverts "Bubonic plague struck a South Bay town today - after the break, find out which one" is completely useless in a world where we have Technorati and Google News to find us the answer before they've finished the link. </p><p>TV people will be the last to notice this, because "here I am, with the nation hanging on my every word" is the dream that brought them into the business in the first place.</p><p><a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005_11_01_epeus_archive.html#113206297683506225">As I said at Streaming Media</a>, the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_02_01_epeus_archive.html#9915313">1940s hack</a> of synchronising everyone's TV set to the same signal was a workaround for having video storage measured in milliseconds.</p><p>By the 70s and 80s we had videotape, so TV could be stored, but it required hugely expensive machines that took work from video engineers to line up to record onto giant reels of two-inch tape. So there was only usually one copy of each program, and lots were wiped and reused. Around the time I got there, the BBC realised that tapes decay - the oxide falls off, and that they had lost 20 years of TV recordings by not having a rolling backup program.</p><p>In 1998, I went to work at Apple on QuickTime, and started work on live streaming. This was hard work, but interesting - making a personal TV Transmitter for anyone with a Mac, so they could use the internet for lots of people to watch them at once. Having built this technology, I started looking for uses for it, and was rather bemused to find there weren't any.</p><p>The problem was storage again. It was always better to have a locally stored copy of the video than to try to get it over the net in real time. It just didn't use the net efficiently, and the 'buffering' experience really sucked. In fact, what I realised was that live TV was a waste of time too. But now we had enough storage.</p><p>People spend lots of money on iPods and TiVo's, whose whole purpose is to turn live streams into files so you can pause and skip them, moving the storage into their houses, and pockets. This personal storage is why Podcasting makes sense. </p><p>Downloading is always better than streaming, and Edited better than Live, except in one instance.</p><p>That difference is when you have 2-way interaction. When you can speak back to the person at the other end, either via iChat AV or Skype, or just by having a textual back channel to a conference.</p><p>That's where Live is needed.</p><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Live TV is Dead" rel="tag">Live TV is Dead</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/television" rel="tag">television</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Response to the UK Parliament's DRM Inquiry</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>In order to address the <a href="http://www.apig.org.uk/current-activities/inquiry-into-digital-rights-management.html">APIG questions on DRM</a>, I need to state some principles.</p><p>Firstly, the Church-Turing thesis, one of the basic tenets of Computer Science, which states that any general purpose computing device can solve the same problems as any other. The practical consequences of this are key - it means that a computer can emulate any other computer, so a program has no way of knowing what it is really running on. This is not theory, but something we all use every day, whether it is Java virtual machines, or Pentiums emulating older processors for software compatibility.</p><p>How does this apply to DRM? It means that any protection can be removed. For a concrete example, consider MAME - the Multi Arcade Machine Emulator - which will run almost any video game from the last 30 years. It's hard to imagine a more complete DRM solution than custom hardware with a coin slot on the front, yet in MAME you just have to press the 5 key to tell it you have paid.</p><p>The second principle is the core one of jurisprudence - that due process is a requirement before punishment. I know the Prime Minister has defended devolving summary justice to police constables, but the DRM proponents want to devolve it to computers. The fine details of copyright law have been debated and redefined for centuries, yet the DRM advocates assert that the same computers you wouldn't trust to check your grammar can somehow substitute for the entire legal system in determining and enforcing copyright law. </p><p>Each computers' immanent ability to become any kind of machine and the copying of data that happens as part of this, leads the DRM advocates naturally to the point where they want to outlaw computers, or to take them over by stealth, using virus-like techniques.</p><p>The reductio ad absurdum of this is to privilege DRM implementers in law above the owners of the computers on which their software runs, without their effective consent. Sadly, this is exactly what is being demanded by the publishers' lobby.</p><p>With those principles established, I will respond to the questions asked by APIG</p><h4>Whether DRM distorts traditional tradeoffs in copyright law</h4><p><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.06/view_pr.html">Yes.</a> DRM arrogates law enforcement to a dumb mechanism. The computer program acts as judge, jury and executioner, and it is controlled by the publisher. It is an attempt to recreate through technological fiat the publishers' dominance, at the expense of both readers and authors, that the Statute of Anne, and subsequent UK copyright laws, were created to fight. Just at the time that computer-based editing, and internet publishing enables all of us to become publishers of our own creative works, the DRM lobby want to re-establish a privileged role for publishers, like the 17th century Stationers' monopoly.</p><h4>Whether new types of content sharing license (such as Creative Commons or Copyleft) need legislation changes to be effective;</h4><p>These are designed to work with current copyright law, and involve a fair degree of complication to make them work legally. Changes in copyright law to reinstate the registration requirement, or to revert to shorter, more defensible terms to clarify public domain status of orphaned works would be advantageous to these licenses.</p><h4>How copyright deposit libraries should deal with DRM issues;</h4><p>The law should require DRM to be removed, or for the creator of the DRM to fund sufficient emulation software that their publication can be accessed by future scholars. An earmarked tax on DRM may be appropriate here, just as the Statute of Anne provided penalties for not submitting publications in a useful form. </p><h4>How consumers should be protected when DRM systems are discontinued;</h4><p>Consumers are generally wise enough to reject DRM systems. Seeing them discontinued reinforces this wisdom. However, a requirement to provide DRM-free copies to the copyright deposit libraries will help. </p><p>A more robust requirement would be for the DRM-using publisher to be required to fund the costs of archival copying and emulation until the copyrighted work is released to the public domain, so that this does not burden the limited budgets of copyright libraries. As reliance on DRM frequently leads to bankruptcy due to consumer rejection, mandating the purchase of an annuity to fund this by DRM practitioners may be the safest course.</p><h4>To what extent DRM systems should be forced to make exceptions for the partially sighted and people with other disabilities;</h4><p>DRM systems should make exceptions for everyone. They should warn but not enforce. The computer cannot know if I am partially sighted, or have other requirements for transformative software.</p><h4>What legal protections DRM systems should have from those who wish to circumvent them;</h4><p>None. My computer is mine; it is not owned by people trying to sell me media. They should have no control over what I do with it. This is prior restraint that reverses the presumption of innocence, and makes the increasingly false assumption that individuals are passive viewers of media, not the creators they evidently are. Penalties for actual copyright infringement are severe enough, let those suffice.</p><h4>Whether DRM systems can have unintended consequences on computer functionality;</h4><p>They can be huge. DRM systems inevitably lead to a power grab by publishers to take control of our computers - the Sony DRM debacle illustrates this clearly. As DRM is inherently ineffective, lobbying leads to an effort to repeal by fiat the underlying mathematical laws that govern computers, and the demand for draconian powers over others' computers grows. Any interference by DRM systems with computer owners' ability to listen to, create, edit and publish media should continue to be illegal, and criminal prosecutions under the Computer Misuse Act should be initiated against Sony/BMG and First4Internet for their assault on our computers.</p><h4> The role of the UK Parliament in influencing the global agenda for this type of technical issue.</h4><p>The UK Parliament set the precedent for Copyright law in the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne">Statute of Queen Anne</a> that defended authors from rapacious publishers, and which has served as the basis for global copyright law ever since. Re-reading it for this essay, I was struck by how well it balanced authors', readers' and publishers' rights:</p><blockquote><p>Whereas printers, booksellers, and other persons have of late frequently taken the liberty of printing, reprinting, and publishing, or causing to be printed, reprinted, and published, books and other writings, without the consent of the authors or proprietors of such books and writings, to their very great detriment, and too often to the ruin of them and their families: for preventing therefore such practices for the future, and for the encouragement of learned men to compose and write useful books; </p></blockquote><p>We also recall <a href="http://www.baen.com/library/palaver4.htm">Macauley's judicious balancing in 1841</a>:</p><blockquote><p>It is good that authors should be remunerated; and the least exceptionable way of remunerating them is by a monopoly. Yet monopoly is an evil. For the sake of the good we must submit to the evil; but the evil ought not to last a day longer than is necessary for the purpose of securing the good.</p></blockquote><p>The independence of both MPs and Peers from the extremes of special interest lobbying that bedevil the US Congress and House give an opportunity for the principles of free expression, of jurisprudence, and of underlying scientific facts to hold sway over the fear-mongering fictions of professional fantasists.</p><br /><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/apig-drm.html">also posted here</a><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/copyright" rel="tag">copyright</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/DRM" rel="tag">DRM</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/law" rel="tag">law</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/rhetoric" rel="tag">rhetoric</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/sony" rel="tag">sony</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Susan Cheever can't tell a metaphor from a dining table</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  In a remarkably thoughtless piece, <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/columnists/ny-etcolumn4549299dec12,0,7399981.column?coll=ny-news-columnists">Susan Cheever writes:</a><blockquote><p>It's late at night, and you are in the bedroom cruising auction sites for furniture on the Internet. You should go to sleep, but you don't. Then you see them, the pair of chairs from your own living room. They are for sale by someone in New Jersey, but they are your chairs. You can even see the stains on the blue one where your son spilled some orange juice and the stitching on the slipcover you repaired. What are they doing out there in cyberspace?</p><p>You go into the living room and, sure enough, they are gone, leaving gaping spaces on the floor where they once stood. A table is gone, too, the one your father built for you when you got your own place. The bowl you had as a centerpiece is shattered on the floor. It's a strange experience to see your own property in someone else's possession when they haven't asked your permission for it or paid for it. It's disorienting and infuriating. You've been robbed. That's how it feels when something of yours suddenly appears in cyberspace, whether it's a chair or a book excerpt, a table or a newspaper column.</p></blockquote>By using this plonkingly inaccurate metaphor, Cheever helps us clearly differentate theft from copyright infringement. Lets rewrite it to more accurately reflect what is going on:<blockquote><p>It's late at night, and you are in the bedroom cruising auction sites for furniture on the Internet. You should go to sleep, but you don't. Then you see them, the pair of chairs from your own living room. They are for sale by someone in New Jersey, but they are your chairs. You can even see the stains on the blue one where your son spilled some orange juice and the stitching on the slipcover you repaired. What are they doing out there in cyberspace?</p><p>You go into the living room and they are still there. Evidently someone loved your table and chairs enough to make a perfect copy of them and share them with the world. It's a strange experience to see your own property so appreciated.

  <span class="p-name">Wikipedia and the nature of truth</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I touched on this briefly yesterday, but <a href="http://akma.disseminary.org/">AKMA</a> has made me think about it further.<br/>There has been a raging debate in academia over truth and the construction of knowledge for decades. and for most of us it has indeed been an academic discussion (intereresting that 'academic' can be used as a put down just as 'amateur' can be).<br/><br /><br/>What the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/weekinreview/04seelye.html?ex=1291352400&amp;en=6a97402d6595c6f1&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">Seigenthaler incident</a> and the Wikipedia stuff I have been involved in show is that these arguments now have a large public experimental laboratory, as we can now all publish our thoughts on them.<br/><br /><br/>As ever, <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html">Douglas Adams nailed it 6 years ago</a>: <blockquote>Because the Internet is so new we still don&#8217;t really understand what it is. We mistake it for a type of publishing or broadcasting, because that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re used to. So people complain that there&#8217;s a lot of rubbish online, or that it&#8217;s dominated by Americans, or that you can&#8217;t necessarily trust what you read on the web. Imagine trying to apply any of those criticisms to what you hear on the telephone. Of course you can&#8217;t &#8216;trust&#8217; what people tell you on the web anymore than you can &#8216;trust&#8217; what people tell you on megaphones, postcards or in restaurants. Working out the social politics of who you can trust and why is, quite literally, what a very large part of our brain has evolved to do. For some batty reason we turn off this natural scepticism when we see things in any medium which require a lot of work or resources to work in, or in which we can&#8217;t easily answer back &#8211; like newspapers, television or granite. Hence &#8216;carved in stone.&#8217; What should concern us is not that we can&#8217;t take what we read on the internet on trust &#8211; of course you can&#8217;t, it&#8217;s just people talking &#8211; but that we ever got into the dangerous habit of believing what we read in the newspapers or saw on the TV &#8211; a mistake that no one who has met an actual journalist would ever make. One of the most important things you learn from the internet is that there is no &#8216;them&#8217; out there. It&#8217;s just an awful lot of &#8216;us&#8217;.</blockquote><br /><br/><br /><br/>I think the right approach is to write out your own version of things online, so that people can read your point of view, to allow it to be cited in places like wikipedia that attempt to arrive at truth, and to point out in public when people publish false things about you.<br/> <br/><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/truth" rel="tag">truth</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/wikipedia" rel="tag">wikipedia</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Of Bloggercon and Podcasting</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>As it is now such a <a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10802_3-5980758.html">focus</a> of <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/%22adam+curry%22+podcasting">discussion</a>, here are my recollections of Bloggercon 2003 and Podcasting.</p>On the first day, when we were all in the same room, I was sitting there webcasting live, and Adam Curry was in the row behind.<br /><img src="http://www.bricklin.com/ALBUMS/bloggercon2003/0b621070.jpg" width="100%" /><br />During one of the breaks, I introduced myself and mentioned that I knew he was interested in Audioblogging (as we called it then), and showed him the Python script I'd written to automatically download mp3 enclosures to iTunes. <a href="http://www.blognewsnetwork.com/members/0000001/2003/10/05.html">His reaction was</a> that this was cool, and that I should show it off in the Audioblogging session the next day, which I duly did, thanks to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100368/">Harold Gilchrist</a> making time for me.<br />You can see me downloading a song into iTunes from the <a href="feed:http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/categories/syncpod/rss.xml">'syncpod' feed</a> that <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/2003/10/05.html#a4556">Adam created for testing iTunes sync after talking to me</a>.<br /><object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B" width="320" height="256" codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab" ><param name="src" value="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7cAS_dEul22MlEtRFhabkc0a2c/audiopod.m4v"><param name="autoplay" value="false"><param name="controller" value="true"><embed src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7cAS_dEul22MlEtRFhabkc0a2c/audiopod.m4v" width="320" height="256" autoplay="false" controller="true" pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"></embed></object><br /><a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7cAS_dEul22MlEtRFhabkc0a2c/audiopod.mov" rel="enclosure" >Download my Audioblogging speech here.</a><br /><a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7cAS_dEul22MlEtRFhabkc0a2c/audiopod.m4v" rel="enclosure" >Download iPod version of my Audioblogging speech here.</a><br /><br />It is a basic human trait to confabulate a narrative for ourselves that puts us in a good light, and it is hard to remember clearly events that happened a couple of years ago, but blogging lets us play the game of <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/massively_multiplayer_online_t.html">Massively Multiplayer Online Truth, as David Weinberger puts it</a>, by preserving <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_10_01_epeus_archive.html#106527364652597310">contemporary thoughts and notes</a>, which should eventually <a href="http://gonze.com/weblog/rss/2005/12/03#12-3-5">lead</a> to a more coherent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">neutral narrative</a>.<br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Adam Curry" rel="tag">Adam Curry</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/BloggerCon" rel="tag">BloggerCon</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/podcasting" rel="tag">podcasting</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/QuickTime" rel="tag">QuickTime</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/wikipedia" rel="tag">wikipedia</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Searching for TV ads</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  John Battelle notes<a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002064.php"> Tivo is planning to let you search for Ads</a> and has <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000992.php">an elaborate scenario mapped out</a>.<br /><a href="http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2005/11/whither_tv_comm.html">Tim Oren wonders about the effect on production values</a>:<blockquote><p>Such adverts probably don't look like today's. Years of battling the remote and now the DVR have turned commercials into attention grabbing eye candy. And it works, to some extent. The Tundra smacked by a meteor and the SUV carrying singing New Guinea tribesmen are funny, a few times. But if you're searching, not leaning back on the couch during halftime, is that what you want to find? The factual nuggets in those productions are pretty much limited to the brand name and vehicle style.</p><p>Optimizing to inform and motivate a potential customer is likely to produce quite different form and content. If search via TiVo, or Google, becomes a substantial fraction of the useful exposure time to customers, we're looking at a bifurcation in video production styles.</p></blockquote><br />What both of them have missed is the already-existing business that has this solved already, which is <a href="http://qvc.com/">QVC</a>. They have the programs set up to explain the products and they have the web/TV integration that Battelle dreams about. They just need to segment and add the metadata to their productions, so they can show up as feeds and get past the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005_11_01_epeus_archive.html#113206297683506225">LIVE TV mentality</a> they use to drive sales on TV by having fixed quantities that sell out.<br />TV ads as artforms, on the other hand, may have a future, as <a href="http://www.quernstone.com/archives/000883.html">Jonathan Sanderson</a> points out regarding the <a href="http://www.bravia-advert.com/">Sony bouncy balls ad</a>.

  When I posted my<a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005_09_01_epeus_archive.html#112655528174520501"> 5 short arguments against DRM</a>:<ol><li> Computer Users: DRM turns your computer against you</li><li>Computer Scientists: DRM will fail through emulation </li><li> Corporations: DRM has to be undone to be used</li><li> Lawyers: DRM makes machines judge, jury and executioner</li><li>Media Companies: DRM destroys value</li></ol><p>I got some responses that said these looked contradictory. In fact, the DRM industry seems to see the implications. The logic of point 2 &#8212; that a general purpose computer can emulate any digital, and many analog devices&#160;&#8212; for them means that <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004106.php">outlawing general purpose computers</a> makes sense, and that is what they are trying to do, thereby fulfilling points 1 and 4.</p><p>At the same time as they are <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2005/11/23/music-industry-tries-to-hijack-serious-crime-legislation-in-europe/">demanding that law enforcement hand over our phone, email and web browsing histories to them,</a> they are continuing to <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/11/the_sony_rootki.html">install hacking software on our computers</a>.<p>This isn't even new behaviour - they tried to <a href="http://wired-vig.wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,47552,00.html">amend the USA PATRIOT act to let them hack people's computers with impunity</a>.</p><p>Howevr, they do need to remember point 5.

In a future of information auto-organized by folksonomy, we may not even have words for the kinds of sorting that will be going on; like mathematical proofs with 30,000 steps, they may be beyond comprehension. But they'll enable searches that are vast and eerily powerful. We won't be surfing with search engines any more. We'll be trawling with engines of meaning." &#8211; Bruce Sterling</p></blockquote><p>How will we keep up with the "dark, expanding ocean of data we spew"? Algorithms? Social filters? Faster memex-like gadgets? Do we need open algorithms in future search, so that each person can tweak their own preferences? Will we become dependent on social networks to filter the world for us, and if so, are the current representations of social relations too coarse? Will we be spending more and more time creating explicit metadata, like tags, in order to help channel the "expanding ocean"?

  <span class="p-name">Microsoft should fix the vector too</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  According to eWeek, <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1886122,00.asp">Microsoft's antivirus tools will delete Sony's DRM 'Rootkit'</a>. A good start, but how about the infection vector? Microsoft should disable autorunning of programs on CD Insert, as Apple did years ago. As Windows runs such things with the full privileges of the logged-in user, and most users have admin privileges, this is an open door.

  <span class="p-name">DVD sales 'dip' is really growth</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Chris Anderson's <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2005/11/mainstream_melt.html">list of faltering mainstream media</a> includes under 'mixed':<blockquote><p>DVDs: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jul2005/nf2005071_7277_db035.htm">sales growth is slowing dramatically</a>, from 29% last year to single digits this year.</blockquote><p>Hang on a second there, that isn't a fall, it's a dip in the 2nd derivative - if it grew 29% last year and ~ 10% this year, it's still doing well. Notice also that the linked article mentions that studios have been shortening the wait between cinematic and DVD release. Think about the impact that has - it moves DVD sales earlier, thus giving an artificial short-term boost that will eventually even out.</p>

  <span class="p-name">DRM's power grab gets more naked</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I think this week may be when the supposed middle ground of DRM vanishes. <a href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/ptech-20051020.html">Walt Mossberg</a> and <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2005/08/just_enough_pir.html">Chris Anderson</a> have both spoken against harsh protection, but stopped short of condemning DRM outright, unlike <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?cat=35">David Berlind</a>. <br/>This week we have had <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2092">Sony/BMG adopting the techniques of virus writers</a> to wrest control of your PC from you, and the <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004106.php">MPAA proposing legislation to cripple all our video cameras and computers</a> unless we are "professionals".</p><p>This is the first of my <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2005_09_01_epeus_archive.html#112655528174520501">5 points</a>: DRM Turns your computer against you.<br/>Sony will feel a backlash due to the value destruction they inflict on their customers (point 5), and their sales will fall. Microsoft should disable the CD Autorun feature used as an infection vector by Sony, as Apple did 7 years ago. </p><p>The MPAA attempt, though is serious. They managed to pass a <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_06_01_epeus_archive.html#385169433">similar law in 1998</a> that mandated Macrovision video signal corruption, and faulty AGC circuitry for non-professional video recorders. This is why you can't run your DVD player signal through your VCR, and why dubbing copies of your home videos is so awkward.</p><p>I worked long and hard at Apple for 5 years making the digitisation of video work easily and seamlessly, so we could all edit video, so my children could <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/buttons.mov" rel="enclosure">create and share with the world</a>, and this stupid law will deliberately undo our work and break our computers and cameras on purpose. <br/>It goes without saying that it will do nothing to prevent large scale commercial copying of movies, as this is done with professional equipment, and is already illegal and subject to huge fines. All it will do is yet again invert the legal presumption of innocence (point 4), and assume that my boys' videos, and your own recordings are copyright violations, and stop them from being digitised.</p><p>The '<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/analog_hole_discussion_draft.pdf">Analog Holes</a>' they want to stop up are our eyes, ears and mouths.</p><br/><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/DRM" rel="tag">DRM</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/law" rel="tag">law</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Technology should be amoral</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2005/10/the_amorality_o.php">Nicholas Carr's 'The amorality of Web 2.0'</a> has an underlying rhetorical premise that is flawed, and <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/10/the_amorality_of_web_20.html">Tim O'Reilly's defence</a> ignores this.<br /><br />Technology should be amoral. Morality is difficult stuff that should be left to humans to deal with. At best, technology can help inform humans to make moral choices, but to argue, as both sides in this debate seem to be doing, that technology can be moral in itself is to take a dangerous step.<br /><br />We have millennia of literature arguing against devolving moral choice to simple mechanistic reasoning, from the Solomonic compromise, through the cautionary tales of golems to the modern myths like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0780022181%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0780022181%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Brazil</a>. <br /><br />Indeed, lets look at contemporary cases where we are asked to devolve moral judgements to machines. <a href="http://hyperorg.com/blogger/">David Weinberger</a>'s <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.06/view_pr.html">Copy Protection is a Crime</a> essay sets out this category error clearly - that DRM eliminates leeway by handing control to stupid mechanisms:<blockquote>In reality, our legal system usually leaves us wiggle room. What's fair in one case won't be in another - and only human judgment can discern the difference. As we write the rules of use into software and hardware, we are also rewriting the rules we live by as a society, without anyone first bothering to ask if that's OK.</blockquote><br /><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?cat=35">David Berlind</a> and <a href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/ptech-20051020.html">Walt Mossberg</a> have picked up on this too, realising that code is not good at subtlety and judgement.<br /><br />Similarly the <a href="http://censorware.net/">Censorware Project</a> and the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/palfrey/2005/10/13#a991">OpenNet Initiative</a> document the shortcomings of using computers to decide whose idea can be seen online by crude keyword filtering.<br /><br />When designing software and the social architecture of the web we do need to think about these issues, but we must eschew trying to encode our own, or others, morality into the machine.<br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/DRM" rel="tag">DRM</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Tags and cognitive load</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I've <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/scstagsbof.asx">talked about this before</a>, but not written it down.</p><p>One of the criticisms of tags is that they are 'just keywords again', which is true. The key difference is that they are experienced differently by the users, in a way that imposes much less cognitive load.</p> <p>iPhoto has had an image keywords feature since it was first launched, but I don't know anyone who uses it. Conversely, Flickr's tagging is used by most of its users.</p><p>Part of this is down to the effect of working in public rather than private, as discussed in another context in <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/01/01/cory.html">Cory's classic 'outboard brain' essay</a>, where the sense of public performance changes the psychology of annotation.</p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmarks/55291032" title="iPhoto keywords by Kevin Marks, on Flickr"><img align="right" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/31/55291032_f1e072ef32_m.jpg" width="159" height="240" alt="iPhoto keywords"></a>But a key part of it is the cognitive load of the user interface.</p> <p>With iPhoto, in order to tag something, you need to first dig around in the menubar to bring up the Keywords dialog, illustrated here.</p><p>Then you need to create a new Keyword (which is buried under the popup at the top).</p><p>Then you need to select the photos that you want to tag with that keyword in the main window, then go back to the Keywords window and click 'Assign'.</p><p>This is not just a four-stage process, it has 2 stages that impose a big cognitive load, of the kind Cory describes as <blockquote>one of those get-to-it-later eat-your-vegetables best-practice housekeeping tasks like defragging your hard drive or squeegeeing your windshield that you know you should do but never get around to.</blockquote></p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmarks/55291033" title="iPhoto new keyword by Kevin Marks, on Flickr"><img align="right" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/30/55291033_6a2699eb84_o.png" width="276" height="134" alt="iPhoto new keyword"></a>Being handed a list of keywords and asked to add your desired ones is in effect asking you to construct a personal ontology of the world; to break the world into categories you want to keep track of. To hold the entire universe in your head in one go, and chop it into meaningful chunks. That's too mentally exhausting for most people. Plus, as creating a keyword is a 2-stage process, it feels a bit like they are rationed.</p><p>Then, the implied second task is to go and find all the pictures you have taken that fit that keyword. Again, this involves scanning through possibly thousands of images looking for the right one.</p><p>Now these aren't actual constraints; you can just create one tag and apply it to one photo, but the process makes it feel like a big deal, and something that you should consider carefully before doing it. So hardly anyone does it.</p> <p>Conversely, <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> prompts you for tags for each batch of photos you upload, and shows you each individual photo with a place to type tags in next to it. You look at the picture and type in the few words it makes you think of, move on to the next, and you're done. The cognitive load is tiny, because you have the picture in front of you and you can't help but think of words to describe it.</p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinmarks/55291030" title="Aperture keywords by Kevin Marks, on Flickr"><img align="right" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/29/55291030_d9092e5600_o.png" width="254" height="199" alt="Aperture keywords"></a><a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a>, Apple's new application for professional photographers, seems to have come up with a better solution than iPhoto. It has a pane in the general photo view that lets you freely enter keywords (one at a time, by the look of it, but I assume they go into the list below as you do so). However, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/specs.html">list of tech specs</a> includes a long list of predefined tags. This is puzzling - why do they feel the need to list tags for 'Bridesmaid' and 'Groomsman' and so on as a feature? </p><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/Aperture" rel="tag">Aperture</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/iPhoto" rel="tag">iPhoto</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/keywords" rel="tag">keywords</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/ontology" rel="tag">ontology</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/photography" rel="tag">photography</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/tagcamp" rel="tag">tagcamp</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/tags" rel="tag">tags</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/taxonomy" rel="tag">taxonomy</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Resilient File Formats</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  On the question of which file formats succeed, the answer is those that are resilient. The ones that provide a method for expansion, and a way for multiple versions to coexist safely.Backwards compatibility is a necessary part of this, but it is not sufficient - forwards compatibility is what wins out.<br />I see 3 big generations of file format here:<br /><ol><li>RFC 822 style (ASCII key:value, as in Mail headers and HTTP headers)</li><br /><li>IFF style (keyed binary blobs with length offsets) (IFF, AIFF, TIFF, QuickTime, WAV, AVI, MPEG4)</li><br /><li>SGML style (ASCII &lt;tag&gt; &lt;/tag&gt; model) (SGML, HTML, XML, XHTML)</li></ol><br />In each case, these define a way for different versions of the same format to coexist by defining that it is OK to discard elements you don't understand.<br />This provides baseline compatibility (old parsers generally don't crash on new data, unlike more naive formats), but still requires work to define the sub elements of the format to interoperate.<br />It provides for graceful degradation, with older or less-featured clients able to display the subset they understand, rather than balking completely.<br />If you replace an element with a more general one, you may need to continue to include the old version for the previous generation of parsers.<br />Having worked at Apple on QuickTime for 5 years, and spent 10 years before that tracking it, I've seen that it does take some care to adapt and update in a way that will not break old clients, but the benefits for users of your format are immense (the unofficial motto there was 'no movie left behind'). Of course, if your users are happy, this helps your adoption.<br />HTML took this from SGML, and in many ways expanded it further due to the toleration of sloppy markup from user-agents, to the point where people writing parsers had a bit of tough time of it.<br />XML was an over-reaction to this - it instituted draconian parsing by design, and effectively gave the green light for everyone to make up their own format without consideration for others at all (with namespaces as a figleaf to cover this, and coerce coexistence post hoc).<br />Microformats build on the older model of backward compatibility through selective enhancement. This is a bit more work for the parser and format designer, but much less for those creating data using the format, who can readily pick up the latest version to enhance their existing HTML without harming their other uses.<br />Working within XHTML does impose constraints on how you can express things, but as <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2005/09/26/themepunks_3/print.html">Cory Doctorow put it last week</a>:<blockquote>"It's like this: engineering is all about constraint. Given a span of foo feet and materials of tensile strength of bar, build a bridge that doesn't go all fubared. Write a fun video-game for an eight-bit console that'll fit in 32K. Build the fastest airplane, or the one with the largest carrying capacity... But these days, there's not much traditional constraint. I've got the engineer's most dangerous luxury: plenty. All the computational cycles I'll ever need. Easy and rapid prototyping. Precision tools.</blockquote><br /><br />Working with constraints is what makes for good Art, and good Engineering, whether the constraints are cultural or structural.<br />Without shared meaning there can be no communication. Microformats work to converge shared meaning without disrupting other uses, and to enhance rather than replace what you are doing already.<br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/microformats" rel="tag">microformats</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/tags" rel="tag">tags</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Future of TV thoughts</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I've been spending the day at the <a href="http://conference.archival.tv/index.php?title=Program">future of TV conference</a> I mentioned below, and am hearing recurring themes from people here, which mesh with a lot I've been thinking.<br /><br />I spoke about a key technological driver, which is storage. Classic broadcast TV had everyone watching at the same time, because there is no storage at all. The next iteration is a central archive, but these are fragile - witness the BBC's loss of large numbers of programs from the 80s due to videotape erosion. Tivo, iPod and BitTorrent are manifestations of storage moving to the edge, streams becoming files, and giving us more choice. Streaming is a throwback to the 2nd model - Rick Prelinger says 'streaming is for sissies'. Multiple copies spread to the edges are more resilient, and more remixable, and so create a larger cultural footprint.<br /><br />Old school search looks at the content, and tries to derive metadata from it. With text we can find keywords, but with audio and video this is difficult. The classic attempt is to scrape closed captions, try shot detection, try phonetic transcription, but all of these don't help much.<br /><br />Traditional media production goes through a broadcast funnel that strips out all the structure that was there while it was being made - shots, scenes, production notes, alternative takes. DVD production is finally preserving some of this, but it is often explicit recreation.<br /><br />Then there is the afterlife of media, which is its cultural impact and the discussion, recommendations, remixing and inspiration that goes on afterwards, and which provides the richer context and description. <br /><br />What is happening is that the edge culture, the long tail, is spreading a bigger footprint, while the locked-up media from the centre is shrinking it context. My cousin Robert does video restoration for the BBC, and often relies on discovered amateur recordings to reconstruct destroyed recordings. <br /><br />So how do we help this? Tagging, citing and annotating are already working for text and pictures, lets do this for audio and video too.<br /><br />A good step would be to converge on a way to add media metadata that is easy to create and share. We've started a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/process">microformat process</a> by collecting <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/media-metadata-examples">media metadata examples</a>.<br /><br />Another thing I heard from multiple people is a desire for a way to pay for the media created by remix culture. My <a href="http://mediagora.com/">mediAgora</a> idea comes to mind.<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/long tail" rel="tag">long tail</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/microformats" rel="tag">microformats</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/podcasting" rel="tag">podcasting</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/power law" rel="tag">power law</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/BBC" rel="tag">BBC</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/tags" rel="tag">tags</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/video" rel="tag">video</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <a href="http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=11855_0_11_0_C"> Chris Anderson writes in Always On:</a><blockquote>the Long Tail model, which was born in March 2004. <br />[...]I met with a guy named Robbie Vann-Adib&#233; who at the time was running a digital jukebox company called Ecast. During the course of our conversation, Robbie asked me what percentage of his top 10,000 tracks I thought sold at least once per month? <br />[...]The answer was 98%&#8212;that is, 98% of Ecast's top 10,000 tracks sell at least once per month. When I get something this badly wrong&#8212;when I have a data point that's just way off the line&#8212;I have to ask whether one of two things is true. Either you've got an outlier&#8212;meaning (in this case) that there's just something funky about the digital jukebox business&#8212;or there's something going on that warrants further investment.</blockquote><br />This timeline seems a bit odd to me. Personally, I think I first articulated this in <a href="http://mediagora.blogspot.com/2002_09_01_mediagora_archive.html#85484840">r, K or RIAA?</a>:<blockquote><p>[in biology] you'll see a clear distinction between r and K reproductive strategies. I'll summarize briefly - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-selection">K strategies</a> work in a stable, restricted environment that is near to carrying capacity (eg the Billboard chart and radio playlist, or record shop stock). In this case, the successful strategy is to have few offspring, and invest lots of effort on nurturing them and helping them to survive.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-selection">r strategies</a> work in an unpredictable environment where you are not near the carrying capacity of the environment (the Internet). Here the successful strategy is to have huge numbers of offspring with a low investment of effort, let them loose and expect that enough will do well and survive to keep your species going.</p><p> If you're a K strategist that finds yourself in an less predictable and less closed environment than you thought, you need to move closer to the r model, and spread your seed more widely. It seems the Record Industry is doing the opposite.</p></blockquote><br />I can understand Chris not reading obscure websites I wrote 3 years ago, but how about <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,60948,00.html">Gary Wolf's Wired article in October 2003</a> which said:<blockquote><p>All of Amazon's important innovations - starting from the concept of a Web bookstore - have suggested a profound change in the bookselling business, a change that makes it possible to earn a profit by selling a much wider variety of books than any previous retailer, including many titles from the so-called long tail of the popularity curve. 'If I have 100,000 books that sell one copy every other year,' says Steve Kessel, an Amazon VP, 'then in 10 years I've sold more of these, together, than I have of the latest Harry Potter.'</p></blockquote><br />I think Chris Anderson was editor of Wired at the time.<br /> <br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/long tail" rel="tag">long tail</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/power law" rel="tag">power law</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">5 short arguments against DRM</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>I have seen several discussions of Digital Rights Management again recently. Having blogged on this folly at enormous length in the past, I thought instead I'd apply my targetted frame technique. Here are some anti-DRM arguments framed for 5 different groups:</p><br /><h4> Computer Users: DRM turns your computer against you</h4><br /><p>I know sometimes it seems like your computer has its own agenda, when it refuses to print or copy or find your documents. DRM does this on purpose. It is designed to stop you copying and pasting, printing and sharing things. I don't think you want this.</p><br /><h4> Computer Scientists: DRM will fail through emulation</h4><p>One of the basic precepts of Computer Science is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church-Turing_thesis">Church-Turing thesis</a>, which shows that any computer can emulate any other one. This is not theory, but something we all use every day, whether it is Java virtual machines, or CPU's emulating older ones for software compatibility.</p><p>The corollary of this is that code can never really know where it is running. For a rock solid example, look at <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME, the Multi-Arcade Machine Emulator</a>, that runs almost any video game from the last 30 years. The games think you have paid a quarter when you press the '5' key.</p><br /><h4>Corporations: DRM has to be undone to be used</h4><p>Microsoft has been touting DRM features in the next version of Office that will only allow approved people to copy or forward or print documents that they can read. But if they can read them, they can describe, paraphrase, retype or photograph them. If you can't trust your employees, but think you can trust your computers more, you have deeper problems than document leakage.</p><br /><h4>Lawyers: DRM makes machines judge, jury and executioner</h4><p>Law is complex and subtle, with elaborate and oft-satirised processes and procedures for making, enforcing, fighting and settling contentious issues. Due process is there for good reasons which I don't need to rehearse to you.</p><p>DRM undoes all this with the simplistic, hard-edged certainty of a machine. It will refuse to let you copy video you have shot yourself, or prevent citation by copying and pasting. It will make presumptions of guilt rather than innocence. Some tasks we can delegate to machines; law and jurisprudence should not be one.</p><br /><h4>Media Companies: DRM destroys value</h4><p>By adding DRM to your products, you make them less attractive to your potential customers. This will reduce the amount they are willing to pay for them, significantly. </p><p>Companies that bet on DRM die off. Apple's iTunes store (often cited as a DRM success) will burn Audio CDs, so it preserves the customer value.</p><br /><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/drm" rel="tag">drm</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a></p>

  <span class="p-name">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Edward Scissorhands as geek parables</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  After seeing and enjoying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00005JNSK%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00005JNSK%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>, I realised the boys hadn't seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00004U8P8%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00004U8P8%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Edward Scissorhands</a>, so we watched that together too.<br /><br />Seeing them consecutively made me realise that they both are parables of how it is to be a geek in the world. The way Edward Scissorhands gently satirises Californian suburban life was much clearer now I've been living it for a while. At it's core, though, it is a classic 'geek versus jock' battle over a girl, but there is a lot of layered subtext about trying to make sense of unusual abilities in an world with other assumptions.<br /><br />The father of Edward's adoptive family waxes lyrical on Ed going into business on his own "There's nothing like running your own business. I've never done it myself, but from what I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a working man can have. So I guess the bank's going to be your next step, huh?"<br />His loan is of course denied through blank incomprehension, and he is led into crime.<br /><br />Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, by contrast, has Depp as a post-dotcom bubble geek, with enough money to indulge his rococo taste in factory design and furnishings. It also has a darker subtext, with Wonka's paranoia about his secret formulae being stolen, and his mass onshoring by replacing the local workforce with imported Oompa-Loompa's who literally work for beans.<br /><br />In both films a good, ordinary family is the path to redemption, but Edward ends up estranged and alone, making beautiful sculptures no-one sees; Wonka, by contrast, brings Charlie's family into his own hermetic world. I'm not sure if either of these is a moral ending, though.

  <a href="http://techcentralstation.com/082305A.html">Arnold Kling</a> tries to apply <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Long+Tail" rel="tag">Long Tail</a> thinking to politics - I think there is something to this, but it goes back to coalition building. In order to gain support for a cause we need to be able to craft arguments for it that appeal to different political worldviews.<br /><br />For example, here's the argument against copyright term extension reframed for different political views:<br /><dl><dt>Liberal collectivist</dt><dd>The shared culture of society should belong to the people together, not to faceless corporations.</dd><br /><dt>Libertarian</dt><dd>Our ability to express ourselves freely should not be constrained by a state-granted monopoly.</dd><br /><dt>Liberal Economist</dt><dd>As non-rivalrous goods with a vanishingly small marginal cost of reproduction, cultural goods reach maximum utility by being freely replicable.</dd><br /><dt>Conservative</dt><dd>Creating property rights in goods that can be duplicated at will is inflationary, and undermines the value of real physical property that is the bedrock of a stable society.</dd></dl><br />Each of these is a facet of the issue, and a defensible position, but if you have a mismatch between the argument and the political frame of your audience, you will be met with incomprehension or hostility, and won't win for your cause.<br /><br />Updated: <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Larry Lessig</a> debated this very issue right after the Eldred case. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030130020045/http://www.aotc.info/">Doc's thoughts</a>, <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/000889.shtml">Larry's response</a>.<br /><br />In answer to Doc's comment about 'Commons' putting off the libertarians and the right, I'd like to suggest 'Digital Commonwealth' as a more neutral political term.<br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/creative commons" rel="tag">creative commons</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/digital rights" rel="tag">digital rights</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/long tail" rel="tag">long tail</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/meme" rel="tag">meme</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Digital Commonwealth" rel="tag">Digital Commonwealth</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Foo, Bar and Dormice</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  This weekend's <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Foocamp" rel="tag">Foo camp</a> and <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Barcamp" rel="tag">Bar camp</a> set me thinking about how important physical proximity is. One of the tenets of the Open Source movement was that in the Internet age, physical co-presence is no longer needed - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">your operating system</a> can be run from Finland, your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype">VoIP service</a> from Luxembourg, and both can draw on global collaborators.<br /><br />Perhaps it was this idea of decentralisation that got <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/">Tim O'Reilly</a> to put his publishing company in Sebastopol in the first place - and certainly they do a great job of publishing books by scattered authors.<br /><br />However, if you're going to visit O'Reilly there, you need to make at least a day of it &#8212; from my house in San Jose I can get to Boston by air in about the same time it takes me to drive to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/frauenfelder/449201/">Sebastopol</a> &#8212; so Tim making a virtue from a necessity, and organising a camp there was a brilliant move. One of the strengths of <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/foocamp05">Foo</a> is that it brings in people from further afield than the Bay Area.<br /><br />Conversely, being based here means that there are lots of <a href="http://www.tagtuesday.com/">events</a> going on, and <a href="http://barcamp.org/">Bar</a> was an example of <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2005/08/the_camp_where_.html">what that clustering can do</a>.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0670033820.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" style="float:right"/> <p>Which brings me back to Markoff's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0670033820%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0670033820%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">What the Dormouse Said</a>, whose thesis is that it was the combination of the chip companies, Stanford, and the SF counterculture that built the computing world we live in now. They needed the physical proximity then, and going to <a href="http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2005/06/a_tribute_to_on.php">PARC to hear from Doug Englebart and Larry Tesler</a> about those days was fascinating.</p>And yet, the collaboration tools they dreamed of then are now coming to fruition, in the way that I can contact <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/08/21/foo_camp.html">friends</a> in both camps, and <a href="http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2005/8/22/1160598.html">others worldwide</a> from my computer or sidekick.<br />I managed to get a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/limbo/35544848/">live broadcast</a> up from Bar camp so far-flung friends could watch and react via <a href="irc://freenode.ner/#barcamp">IRC</a>, but attempts to get video out of Foo camp were stymied by their NAT and router. Global textual collaboration has been here for a while; adding video and audio is still a work in progress.<br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Barcamp" rel="tag">Barcamp</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Foocamp" rel="tag">Foocamp</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/microformat" rel="tag">microformat</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/microformats" rel="tag">microformats</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Adam Smith and microformats principles</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.knowledgeproblem.com/archives/001356.html"> Lynne Kiesling quotes Adam Smith</a><blockquote>The man of system, on the contrary, is apt to be very wise in his own conceit; and is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it. He goes on to establish it completely and in all its parts, without any regard either to the great interests, or to the strong prejudices which may oppose it. He seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess-board. He does not consider that the pieces upon the chess-board have no other principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might chuse to impress upon it. If those two principles coincide and act in the same direction, the game of human society will go on easily and harmoniously, and is very likely to be happy and successful. If they are opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder.</blockquote><a href="http://microformats.org/about/">microformats.org says</a>:<br /><blockquote><h4>microformats are not:</h4><ul><li>a new language</li><li>infinitely extensible and open-ended</li><li>an attempt to get everyone to change their behavior and rewrite their tools</li><li>a whole new approach that throws away what already works today</li><li>a panacea for all taxonomies, ontologies, and other such abstractions</li><li>defining the whole world, or even just boiling the ocean</li><li>any of the above</li></ul></blockquote><br />Smith contrasts:<br /><blockquote>The man whose public spirit is prompted altogether by humanity and benevolence, will respect the established powers and privileges even of individuals [...]<br />He will accommodate, as well as he can, his public arrangements to the confirmed habits and prejudices of the people; and will remedy as well as he can, the inconveniencies which may flow from the want of those regulations which the people are averse to submit to. When he cannot establish the right, he will not disdain to ameliorate the wrong; but like Solon, when he cannot establish the best system of laws, he will endeavour to establish the best that the people can bear.</blockquote>microformats.org continues:<br /><blockquote><h4>the microformats principles</h4><ul><li>solve a specific problem</li><li>start as simple as possible</li><li>design for humans first, machines second </li><li>reuse building blocks from widely adopted standards</li><li>modularity / embeddability</li><li>enable and encourage decentralized development, content, services</li></ul></blockquote><br />I grant you, the microformats prose is terse in comparison, but I see the commonality between the two. Do read <a href="http://www.knowledgeproblem.com/archives/001356.html">Lynne's post</a> in full, and thank you <a href="http://www.janegalt.net">Megan</a> for <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/024855.php">pointing</a> it out.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  When I heard radio reports of the London police shooting a suspect in the tube, my heart sank. It sounded like a failure to capture a suspect, it sounded like another possible attack, but most of all it sounded like the last chapter of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=epeusepigone-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0316172324%2526tag=epeusepigone-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0316172324%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">Blink</a>, where Gladwell analyses closely how easy it is a for a group of armed policemen in hot pursuit to make fatal snap judgements. <br />He <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2111894/">summarized in Slate</a>:<blockquote>We tend to think that high-speed chases are a problem because of the dangers they pose during the chase. That's true enough. But the real problem is the danger they pose after the chase. I cannot tell you how many cops I talked to who spoke of how disoriented and crazed and incoherent they were after racing after someone through streets at 120 miles per hour. You finally cut off the suspect's car. You charge out of the cruiser. You yank open his door. Your pulse is 175. Your heart is in your throat. Your body is awash in adrenalin and cortisol. And everything we know about human physiology and psychology says that no one can make intelligent snap decisions under those circumstances.</blockquote><br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4711021.stm">Today the police said the man was unconnected to the attacks</a>.<br /><br />Updated: Blink's chapter discussed the shooting of Amidou Diallo. <a href="http://finn.blogsome.com/2005/07/24/jean-charles-de-menezes-27/">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> was the man killed in Stockwell.<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/blink" rel="tag">blink</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/london bombings" rel="tag">london bombings</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">London calling</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.lileks.com/screedblog/05/07/070805.html">James Lileks talks</a> of England's spirit revealed through <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=4573799&amp;selectedItemId=4573783">Holst</a>. My internal soundtrack was by <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=702268&amp;selectedItemId=702226">Elgar</a>, but reading blogs I heard the sound of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=23407630&amp;selectedItemId=23407618">The Clash</a> coming through.<blockquote>London calling to the faraway towns<br />Now war is declared and battle come down</blockquote>I heard about the London bombings through <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Coordinated_terrorist_attack_hits_London">wikinews</a> and <a href="http://www.technorati.com/londonbombings/">blogs</a>. I watched people trying to make sense of these attacks together, collecting facts and <a href="http://www.pfff.co.uk/weblog/archives/2005/07/surviving_a_ter.html">telling their stories</a>. Calling out to us.<blockquote>London calling to the zombies of death<br />Quit holding out and draw another breath</blockquote>And calling out <a href="http://www.werenotafraid.com/">defiance</a>, pride and <a href="http://www.lnreview.co.uk/news/005167.php"> history</a> too, whether from <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/plasticbag?m=837">near</a> or <a href="http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2005/7/7/1005032.html">far</a>. <blockquote>London calling yes I was there too<br />An' you know what they said - well some of it was true!<br />London calling at the top of the dial<br />An' after all this won't you <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/index.php?p=971">give me a smile</a>?<br /><br />I never felt so much alike...</blockquote><br />My father and sister both went through affected tube stations that day. That bus blew up <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/05/uk_number_30_bus_bomb_aftermath/html/1.stm">right outside my old office in London</a>.<br />I'm proud of England's response, and that people are getting back to work and play.

  <span class="p-name">Gnomedex calendar the microformat way</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Watching the reports of Gnomedex, I heard about a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=80533#80533">demonstration</a> of extended RSS processing that the Microsoft IE team did regarding a calendar. <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=fdd08282-4d3b-4fb2-a2ba-68d6fced4251">Dare Obasanjo explains:</a><br /><blockquote><br /><p>Dean then started to talk about the power of the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt">enclosure element in RSS 2.0</a>. What is great about it is that it enables one to syndicate all sorts of digital content. One can syndicate video, music, calendar events, contacts, photos and so on using RSS due to the flexibility of enclosures. </p> <p>Amar then showed a demo using Outlook 2003 and an RSS feed of the <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/schedule.phtml">Gnomedex schedule</a> he had created. The RSS feed had an item for each event on the schedule and each item had an <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt">iCalendar file</a> as an enclosure. Amar had written a 200 line C# program that subscribed to this feed then inserted the events into his Outlook calendar so he could overlay his personal schedule with the Gnomedex schedule. The point of this demo was to show that RSS isn't just for aggregators subscribing to blogs and news sites. </p><br /></blockquote>Now, being able to subscribe to an event calendar is very handy, but there is a much simpler way - using <a href="http://www.microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">hCalendar</a> and Brian Suda's <a href="http://suda.co.uk/projects/X2V">x2v calendar parsing too</a>l.<br />I adapted <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/gnomecal.html">the conference calendar page</a>, to add an "hevent" to each session ( with help from <a href="http://theryanking.com">Ryan</a> and his <a href="http://theryanking.com/microformats/hcalendar-creator.html">hCalendar creator</a>).<br /><br />Now you can <a href="http://suda.co.uk/projects/X2V/get-vcal.php?uri=http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/gnomecal.html">subscribe to it directly</a> using the x2v link. This is available today, not in a future release of IE, and you can easily add events to your blog or webpage this way for people to subscribe to<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/gnomedex" rel="tag">gnomedex</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/hCalendar" rel="tag">hCalendar</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/microformat" rel="tag">microformat</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Using the DMCA for good</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.corante.com/copyfight/archives/2005/06/13/do_you_know_your_rights.php">Donna's posting</a> of <a href="http://www.eff.org/bloggers/lg">EFF's legal guide for bloggers</a> reminded me that a DMCA takedown can be used for good as well as evil.<br />There are spammers who copy entire blog posts from others to act as fresh bait for their search spoofing tricks.<br />This is commercial use, and a violation of most CC licenses (and indeed default copyright).<a href="http://climbtothestars.org/">Stephanie Booth</a> recently did this to a spammer at www.famous-people.info who <a href="http://www.famous-people.info/post/jennifer-garner-in-alias/" rel="nofollow">plagiarized</a> one of her posts <a href="http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2005/05/28/interview/">which mentioned Jennifer Garner in passing</a>, on what was a Google Adsense supported spamblog. When she sent a DMCA notice, they took down the page and apparently lost their Adsense status.<br /><br /><a href="http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/050613-153053">Danny Sullivan has a similar problem</a>.<br /><br />I have heard it argued that using the DMCA for this is encouraging reliance on what is in many ways a bad law that should be repealed, but in this case I think it is very positive, as it reinforces the 'everyone is a publisher now' worldview that CC and EFF promote. The DMCA's most pernicious aspect was the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_06_01_epeus_archive.html#385169433">distinction between "professional" businesses who are allowed to copy video, and the general public, who aren't</a>. Copyright makes us all publishers by default, so we should take advantage of this.<br /><br />How to do it: <br />If you look up the IP of the server: <code>&gt;ping www.famous-people.info <br />PING famous-people.info (65.77.133.197): 56 data bytes</code> then <code>whois 65.77.133.197</code> that IP address, you can find the host ISP, and send them a <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/faq.cgi%23QID130">DMCA takedown notice,</a> which they have a procedure in place to deal with.

You don't know you have it right until you have written and read files both ways between different endian architectures.<br /><br />Chapters in podcasts is a good idea, but this needs a bit more to be actually useful - it needs iPod support (the skip button going to the next chapter), and we need the info back from the iPod about which tracks and chapters have been played, and which ones skipped.

  <span class="p-name">Solving Lileks' dilemma</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.lileks.com/bleats">James Lileks</a> has been writing on the web for years, and is consistently brilliant. <a href="http://www.lileks.com/bleats/archive/05/0505/052005.html">Tonight</a> he posted a dilemma he has:<br /><blockquote> I have this template: title on top, illustration, text below, navigation button on the bottom. Everything I&#8217;ve done has been a tweak of that basic idea, and it gets irritating; you see the picture, scroll down, read the text, scroll back up to see the picture again, scroll back down to click next. What if &#8211; <br /><br /> Nah.<br /><br /> No! What if I do the unthinkable, and make the text a graphic? I&#8217;m still playing with this &#8211; it&#8217;ll mean larger file sizes, but maybe I should start to think ahead to a day when the majority of visitors have modems faster than a cold slug on sand. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.lileks.com/NYC/timessquare/0.html">old</a> version. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.lileks.com/bleats/archive/05/0505/0503art/TSproto/index.html">new</a> idea. It's still too busy, but you can see what I'm aiming at. It means more work &#8211; an incredible amount of work, frankly &#8211; but it makes the site look more like the book version I&#8217;d love to do. </blockquote><br />Now Lileks is used to the tables and spacer images layout model, but there is a way he can have his text and his layout without making everything a graphic - HTML + CSS. <br />I spent 15 minutes in <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBEdit</a> and <a href="http://www.macrabbit.com/cssedit/">CSSEdit</a> to make <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7cAS_dEul22MlEtRFhabkc0a2c/tt.html">a 21st century XHTML+CSS version</a>. <br />Note that it is simpler HTML than his old version, but has the approximate layout style of the new version (I'm an engineer Jim, not a typographer). I even got <a href="http://www.workingwith.me.uk/articles/css/cross-browser-drop-shadows/">drop shadows</a> in Safari.<br />I have nothing against DreamWeaver - <a href="http://blog.deeje.tv/musings/">friends of mine</a> work on it - and I'm sure it can do CSS too.<br /><br />Done right, this should actually be less work than either of Lileks&#8217; alternatives.

  <span class="p-name">My tail is longer than yours...</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  This is a belated response to Dave Rogers and friends, which started out <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/05/05/watch-the-waving-hand/">in Shelley's comments</a>, where I said:<br /><blockquote>The <a href="http://www.technorati.com/live/blogpower.swf" >long tail</a> is not a myth, and <a href="http://www.technorati.com/live/bloglinks.swf" >the many do outweigh the few</a>. Pick a few words around a topic that you are interested in and search for them at Technorati and see who you find.<br />The top 100 is not the most interesting page on our site by any means. I wrote about this before - <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2004_07_01_epeus_archive.html#108944175191119011">Call off the Search</a></blockquote><br /><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/GHD05-05.html#note_2124">Dave replied</a>:<br /><blockquote>I think Kevin misunderstands the use of the word &quot;myth&quot; in this context. Whether or not &quot;the many do outweigh the few,&quot; it is the few that most profit. If the Top 100 is not the most interesting page on Technorati, then where does it rank in Technorati's hierarchy of interesting pages? Second? Third? Why is it on the front page at all if it isn't very interesting? Is it not in Technorati's interests to maintain the attention of those in or near the top 100 to influence their attention-directing authority for Technorati's advantage?<br />Finally, why can Technorati claim to be &quot;the authority&quot; on what's going on in weblogs, and then specifically disclaim any responsibility to anyone who relies on that &quot;authority?&quot;<br /><br />I still have hope that Kevin Marks will reply, it is the weekend and he probably has a life, but so far, nothing heard.</blockquote><br /><br />Mike Sanders in <a href="http://keeptrying.blogspot.com/2005/05/main-stream-bloggers-msb-assert-their.html">Main Stream Bloggers (MSB) Assert Their Authority</a>:<br /><blockquote>It didn't take long, but the Main Stream Bloggers (MSB) are asserting their authority.<br />Last week I wrote:<br /><em>The <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html">long tail</a> is a blogging myth in which the heavy-traffic bloggers try to convince the little guys, like you and me, that we are really the important ones in the blogosphere. And we should keep on blogging and linking to the big guys, since collectively the bottom 99% has much more viewership than the top 1% - or something like that.</em></blockquote><br />then characterized my statement above as a decree. I don't follow this; the Top 100, like most of the rest of Technorati, is a reflection of others' links. <a href="http://keeptrying.blogspot.com/2005/05/grand-unifying-force-of-blogosphere.html">Mike doesn't understand</a> the difference between a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html">gaussian</a> and an <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExponentialDistribution.html">exponential distribution</a> either.<br /><br />That was last weekend when I was suffering from food poisoning, and I saw this needed a considered response, rather than a dashed-off one, so I put it off. <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/GHD05-05.html#note_2138">Dave prodded me again this weekend</a>:<br /><blockquote>Technorati, again, as near as I can tell, is held in positive regard, at least by the members of the "A-List." I'll leave it to the reader to decide if this was an act of inspired genius to create a list that simultaneously flatters the egos of the people most in a position to criticize the company, draws attention to itself, and exploits the attention-directing "authority" of high attention-earning webloggers (the A-List) to draw even more attention to itself. I'd say probably not, since it's been done before; but it's still a pretty effective way to garner attention and achieve a measure of insulation from criticism.<br /><br />But here we are a week later and I find myself talking to myself. Neither Keven Marks nor Dave Sifry deigned to entertain my questions. Perhaps I wasn't obsequious enough to merit being taken seriously. Perhaps I lack sufficient authority. I'm absolutely certain there's a "reason." But I don't think there's any explanation that can restore the fiction that "markets are conversations."</blockquote><br /><br />Well, I'll try. I got into blogging in the first place after following the Cluetrain writers here. In particular, <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/egr-list/message/225">Chris Locke goaded his newsletter readers into starting blogs</a>, and I did so. My first few posts had a <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2001_11_01_epeus_archive.html#6988159">similar</a> <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2001_11_01_epeus_archive.html#7053068">blustery</a> <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_01_01_epeus_archive.html#8515517">tone</a> to the one that Dave and Mike have employed with me here, pointing out where I thought others' pronouncements were unsupported or based on misreadings. That Mike thinks I am now a 'Main Stream Blogger' gave me pause, as I feel I have been having a conversation with those who are interested in some of the same, often esoteric, things as I am. What I found over time was that neither obstreperousness or obsequy added value, but considered discussion did. I found that things I wrote could be reflected back to those I cited, and they would sometimes respond, or others would join in. When I met the people I'd been reading and writing with face to face, the conversation was easily picked up and carried on. <br /><br />By tracking people linking to me or mentioning my name, Technorati helps me in this distributed asynchronous conversation (thats how I found Mike and Dave's comments, after all). However, as I've said before, "I can read your thoughts, as long as you write them down first". In order to be in the conversation, you need to be writing and linking. Perforce, this means that those who write and link more, and are written about and linked to more, are those who most see the utility of it. <br /><br />As blogging spread from ten thousand people writing about technology to ten million writing about their lives, their interests, their hopes and fears, characterising any of it as 'mainstream' is a readers choice, as you can only focus on a few narrow tributaries of the Mississippi of writing that surges through our computers every day. Technorati's top 100 list, and listing of the number of inbound links and blogs by search results is a way for you to see how others have linked before - you can click on the little speech-bubbles and see what they said in linking to them, we expose that directly. The top 100 are not some fixed group, they come and go, but in general they link a lot themselves, and write frequently.<br /><br />Dave continues:<blockquote>Markets are about exchanges of value, and those with something to sell will always seek to manipulate the buyers' perception of value. Even if that means pretending to be engaged in the latest hip, trendy, feel-good, manufactured belief system created to garner attention and manufacture the perception of authority for its authors.</blockquote><br />Markets are indeed about exchanges of value, but the market price is an emergent property of this spontaneous order of transactions between individuals, an information network that defies representation and measurement. A market is a spontaneous order, as is a conversation. The subtleties and complexities of these interactions are a source of fascination for me, as they do defy easy representation or theory, and we know that the analyses we can derive from blogging are only partial reflections of a complex reality, but we hope that they may be found useful, and that we can improve them and add to them over time.<br /><br />He concludes:<blockquote>If this criticism garners attention, that is not my intent. My intent is merely to state the truth as best I can perceive it. Any effort to engage in a conversation regarding whether or not Technorati believes "markets are conversations" at this point is merely a further effort to manufacture and shape perception. Hopefully that will inoculate me from having to engage in any pointless, back-and-forth, damage control efforts with either Mr. Marks or Mr. Sifry. If all of you would continue to do me the good favor of ignoring me, I'd appreciate it.</blockquote><br />Bullshit. Of course you wanted my attention, or you wouldn't have repeated it in different places and phrasings. So quit the passive-aggressive reverse psychology posturing and think a bit.<br /><br />Of course conversations are meant to shape perception; if they didn't there would be no point. Doc Searls and David Weinberger express this well, and differently. <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/12/29#authorating">Doc explains</a> that the root of information is that we are trying to form one another. David points out that without each other we are not human - look at children raised by wolves, and says we are writing ourselves into existence online.<br /><br />Blogging is an arrogant act, as you say, Dave, and a personal one, but we are accountable and responsible to one another, and we reveal a lot about ourselves by writing continuously over time.<br /><br />A while ago <a href="http://dave_blog.blogspot.com/archives/2002_02_01_dave_blog_archive.html#9617146">Dave Rogers wrote</a>:<blockquote>To be as authentic/truthful as possible, corporate Web sites must be shaped--as are all conversations--by the voices of the participants. And because the best conversationalists are also the best listeners, this requires Corporate sites that demonstrate that the company knows its visitors--not as mere statistics, focus groups or fat wallets, but as living, breathing, unique individuals--each of inestimable value, not because of what they can give to the company but because of who they are. As Tom asserted, these are sites that "have an interest in what the world says"--not just themselves.</blockquote><br /><br />We're trying to build a site that reflects what the world says, but it will also reflect what you look for within it. The web is <a href="http://nonzero.blogspot.com/2002_03_01_nonzero_archive.html#75021974">Caliban's mirror</a>, and Technorati a magnifying glass in front of it. If you don't like the reflection, you can change where you look, but you can also change what we reflect back with your writing and linking.<!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/long tail" rel="tag">long tail</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/technorati" rel="tag">technorati</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Creative Commons licensing the Katherina movie teaser trailer</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  An old friend of mine in the UK is making a movie, <a href="http://spikedwheel.com/">Katherina</a>, which I am looking forward to seeing. It's a big-budget 35mm production, using British and American talent both in front of and behind the camera about Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who was famously martyred by being broken on a wheel for challenging church authorities in 329AD. <br /><br />He's put together a great teaser trailer based on what's been shot so far, and he asked me how to get it up on the net, as I know this online video stuff.<br /><br />A few years ago the answer would involve complicated hosting and mirroring, and an upfront guess on how many people downloaded it, but it struck me that this was a chance to show how things are different now. <br /><br />I convinced him to use a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons license</a> on the trailer, and I've put up <a href="http://www.prodigem.com/torrents/download/KevinMarks/KevinMarks-katherina.torrent">a high-quality Bittorrent of the Katherina trailer</a>. <br /><br />So, download it, tell your friends, and tag any comments with <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/spikedwheel" rel="tag">spikedwheel</a>.<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bittorrent" rel="tag">bittorrent</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/creative commons" rel="tag">creative commons</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/katherina" rel="tag">katherina</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/movie" rel="tag">movie</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/spikedwheel" rel="tag">spikedwheel</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Long Tails, Big Heads and Feet of Clay</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  One thing that struck me after talking with Chris Anderson about <a href="http://longtail.typepad.com">The Long Tail</a> was that his formulation is in some ways only a small step towards the end of the tail; his focus is mainly on how to exploit niche markets for products like books or movies.<br /><br />There's an old joke that seems apposite here:<br />Q. How do you get to run a small newspaper business?<br />A. Start with a large newspaper business and <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000904039">wait a bit</a>.<br /><br />A true long tail business is one that copes with the ultimate niches - where there are just one, or even zero customers. You need to be sure that your submission model can cope with these limiting cases and not choke, especially as you do not know a priori which ones are going to garner customers.<br /><br />So, what businesses fit this model? The obvious one is eBay. <a href="http://pierre.typepad.com/">Omidyar's</a> model of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316164933/epeusepigone-20">perfect marketplace</a> is tuned so that it is stable if you don't find a buyer (eBay takes a small listing fee), but works better if you do (eBay takes a percentage). Most auctions only have a single successful buyer, but they expanded the model to allow multiple identical goods to be sold too.<br /><br />Another example is <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/mirandablog">cafepress</a>. They don't even set a listing fee, working on the assumption that the effort to build a product list is enough of a hurdle, and have prices set so that a production run of one item is cost effective for them (they aggregate sales and pay monthly). They also have a higher payback rate if you do gather more orders and let economies of scale kick in on their back end.<br /><br />Longer standing examples are the venerable photo-processing by mail business (now undermined by digital cameras) and the newer videotape to DVD service offered by <a href="http://www.yesvideo.com/code/buymenu.htm">YesVideo</a>. In a similar field, there is <a href="http://www.customflix.com/Producer/Intro/OnDemandServices.jsp">CustomFlix</a>, which does on-demand DVD distribution, though with a setup fee that puts breakeven above a single copy (and expects you to make the DVD yourself first).<br /><br />Perhaps the purest of all these businesses is <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&#38;business=kevinmarks%40mac%2ecom&#38;amount=5%2e00&#38;no_shipping=0&#38;no_note=1&#38;tax=0&#38;currency_code=USD">PayPal</a>, which gives away free small transactions, and makes it up in volume from bigger retailers.<br /><br />If you plan your business to cope with this end of the tail, you'll be perfectly placed to reap economies of scale as you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060521996/epeusepigone-20">attack from below</a> both the niche seekers and those still mesmerised by the Big Head. <!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/long tail" rel="tag">long tail</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Google's Singularity machine</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Last Thursday I was invited to Google's Open House night by a friend who works there. I'd have blogged it sooner, but I think my bout of food poisoning at the weekend could have been due to my over-enthusiastic consumption of the rather tasty ceviche there.<br /><br />A lot of what came through from the speeches is (naturally) already public knowledge - the engineer-led culture, the 'index all human knowledge' mission, the 'no scarcity of computing power' mantra.<br /><br />Taken together, however, some aspects of this struck me as interesting. Sergey's talk of the 'founders awards' bonus grants as meaning Google employees didn't need to create a startup to make it big, were an interesting indicator of where he sees their competition, and the vagueness of their terms certainly implied a continuing role for founders fiat in running the company.<br /><br />Larry's talk of 'brute force AI', combined with the triple emphasis on their highly redundant and parallel platform design, and two talks including one by Rob Pike on the Map/Reduce processing model gave a strong indication that they are building a platform designed to do the kinds of parallel, layered computation that modern neural computation models use, and they are planning to feed in all that they can digitize of human knowledge. <br /><br />So while they didn't say 'we want to build the AI that transcends humanity', I suspect that somewhere in their dreams perhaps Mike from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312863551/epeusepigone-20">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a>, or what <a href="http://www.well.com/user/eob/poetry/The_Second_Coming.html">rough beast</a>, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Mountain View to be born?<br /><br />Lets hope it resists corruption better than their shrimp.<br /><!-- technorati tags start --><p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/singularity" rel="tag">singularity</a></p><!-- technorati tags end -->

  <span class="p-name">Maximalist delusions and another modest proposal for the BBC</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/39b697dc-b25e-11d9-bcc6-00000e2511c8.html">James Boyle has an excellent essay on the regulatory capture of IP law</a>:<br /><blockquote>The first thing to realize is that many decisions are driven by honest delusion, not corporate corruption. The delusion is maximalism: the more intellectual property rights we create, the more innovation. This is clearly wrong; rights raise the cost of innovation inputs (lines of code, gene sequences, data.) Do their monopolistic and anti-competitive effects outweigh their incentive effects? That&#8217;s the central question, but many of our decision makers seem never to have thought of it.<br /><br />The point was made by an exchange inside the Committee that shaped Europe&#8217;s ill-starred Database Directive. It was observed that the US, with no significant property rights over unoriginal compilations of data, had a much larger database industry than Europe which already had significant &#8220;sweat of the brow&#8221; protection in some countries. Europe has strong rights, the US weak. The US is winning.<br /><br />Did this lead the committee to wonder for a moment whether Europe should weaken its rights? No. Their response was that this showed we had to make the European rights much stronger. The closed-mindedness is remarkable. &#8220;That man eats only a little salad and looks slim. Clearly to look as good as him, we have to eat twice as much, and doughnuts too!&#8221;<br /><br />Part of the delusion depends on the idea that inventors and artists create from nothing. Who needs a public domain of accessible material if one can create out of thin air? But in most cases this simply isn&#8217;t true; artists, scientists and technologists build on the past. How would the blues, jazz, Elizabethan theatre, or Silicon valley have developed if they had been forced to play under today&#8217;s rules? Don&#8217;t believe me? Ask a documentary filmmaker about clearances, or a free-software developer about software patents.</blockquote><br />Which brings me back to the BBC Creative Archive. Some of the reaction I got to the previous suggestion was that the cost of rights clearance would make it impractical, and why should the UK subside the rest of the world?<br /><br />Sound recordings in the UK made before 1955 are now out of copyright. The BBC was founded in 1922. Start with those 33 years of material in the global pubic archive and see how it goes. If we're right about building on the past encouraging creativity, once the rights-holders see what this does for awareness and CD &#38; DVD sales from those eras, they'll be lining up for a new contract.<br /><br />I'd like to let Douglas Adams get a word or two in here:<br /><br /><object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B" width="320" height="16" codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab"<param name="src" value="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/dna0sum.mov"><param name="autoplay" value="false"><param name="controller" value="true"><embed src="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/dna0sum.mov" width="320" height="16" autoplay="false" controller="true" pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"></embed></object>

  <span class="p-name">BBC goes MP3</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2005/04/some_news_on_the_bbc_and_podcasting.shtml">Tom</a> led me to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/04_april/14/pod.shtml">BBC press release</a>:<blockquote><br /><p> The trial means the BBC will offer its first daily podcasts - the Today programme's 8.10am interview - along with weekly titles and speech highlights from Radio 1 programmes for listeners to download and transfer to portable audio players. [...]<br /> The three programmes taking part in the first mp3 download trial - In Our Time (Radio 4), Fighting Talk (Radio Five Live) and TX Unlimited (1Xtra) - were downloaded a total of 270,000 times in the first four months of the trial.</p></blockquote> that means my <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ican/club30">long campaign</a> to listen to BBC programmes as MP3's, not streams, is finally getting traction. As I said then:<blockquote><h4>WHAT WE WANT:</h4>MP3's not streams - we don't always have a live internet connection. Instead of streaming RealMedia versions of recent programs we can only play on computers with live net connections, we want MP3 files we can download and play later on portable players.<h4>WHY WE WANT IT:</h4>Taking programs with us while doing other things. We don't sit around the radio any more - why sit around the computer? Listening to spoken word radio while at a computer is unsatisfactory - it makes reading and writing text very difficult. Listening to spoken word radio on an iPod while cycling, walking the dog, riding on the bus or tube or even driving the car is much better. </blockquote>The fact that the Beeb is putting up single items from Today, rather than the whole show, is an important step - this move further along the road I <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_10_01_epeus_archive.html">outlined at Bloggercon 2003</a>, to making online media more bloglike:<blockquote>Something I said a few times at Bloggercon is that video and audio are missing the essence of blogging. You can do live video, or you can use your computer to edit together a professional-looking video presentation, but the equivalent of the 'just-in-time' publishing that blogging provide is not there.<br /><a href="http://www.blognewsnetwork.com/members/0000001/2003/10/05.html#a4556">Adam Curry</a> and I had a chat about trying something more like blogging using the RSS 'enclosures'. I have the beginnings of a tool to automatically move audio posts into iTunes (and hence iPods) as I just can't listen to speech radio at the computer - I need to do it while driving.</blockquote>If we can have an auto-assembled morning commute playlist of brief items from lots of people, rather than a 45-minute 'experience' from one, that is a great improvement for both listeners and creators.<br />The BBC <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_08_01_epeus_archive.html#106183058149289667">Creative Archive</a> proposals show promise here - imagine people mining 75 years of historic recordings for great snippets, like the wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0563494042/epeusepigone-20">Douglas Adams at the BBC CD set</a> that brightened my commute last week.<br /><br />What might block this is the <a href="http://creativearchive.bbc.co.uk/archives/all_about_the_licence/licence_faqs/index.html#uk">parochial UK-only remit</a> of the <a href="http://creativearchive.bbc.co.uk/">Creative Archive</a>, and I have a suggestion there that I mentioned to various BBC hands at eTech - use the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/us/annual_review/2003/index.shtml">World Service 'Nation shall speak peace unto nation' remit too</a>:<blockquote><ul><li>Providing a forum for the exchange of ideas across cultural, linguistic and national boundaries.</li><br /><li>To be a global hub for high-quality information and communication.</li><br /><li>Promoting the English language, learning and interest in a modern, contemporary Britain.</li><br /><li>Offering a showcase for British talent across the world.</li></ul></blockquote><br />Sounds like a perfect match - let the World Service globalise the Creative Archive.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  I don't usually blog about family events here, but sometimes it is important.<br />My children have been attending and performing at the San Jose Young People's Theatre for four years now, and it has deeply impressed me.<br />Carole Ferris-Greer, the program director, has created something very special in a quiet corner of the San Jose Parks and Recreation department. For 22 years she has been bringing together a fresh cast of a hundred children every few months, and building them into a performance powerhouse.<br /><br />These are not simple children's pageants, but properly staged, costumed, choreographed performances with complex sets and original staging. Each show is adjusted in rehearsal to fit the children cast in their roles, and every child in the chorus is given a moment to shine.<br /><br />Carole is a master of what <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Larry Lessig</a> calls <a href="http://www.authorama.com/free-culture-4.html">'Walt Disney creativity'</a> - taking classic folk tales, and remixing them with contemporary cultural references to bring them alive for a new generation. Whether it is sly references to reality dating shows in Cinderella, with the stepsisters singing 'Material Girl', the apes singing Louie Louie in Jungle Book, or the replacement of the Indian song in Peter Pan with 'Colors of the Wind', each story is refreshed and updated.<br /><br />So why am I writing about it now?<br /><br />Despite its track record, its huge local support, the 100,000 cans of food it has generated in donations to the homeless, and the thousands of children whose lives have been improved by being part of it, the <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ypt" rel="tag" >Young People's Theatre</a> is under attack by the Parks and Recreation Department of <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/San+Jose" rel="tag" >San Jose</a> city council.<br /><br />Accordingly we have set up a support site at <a href="http://yptsupport.blogspot.com">yptsupport.blogspot.com</a>. We're seeing if the <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/">citizen journalism</a> publishing tools of photos, weblogs and videos can make a difference.<br />Do please visit it, link to it and spread the word. Help us hold the local council to account.<br /><br />And help make sure that future generations of children can experience this too.<br />

You lose status and respect if you are unprofessional or deliberately misleading.

  The <code><a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/RelNoFollow">rel="nofollow"</a></code> has caused a lot of <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/01/20/i-broke-nofollow">impassioned debate</a>, particularly regarding using it to link to things you disagree with or disapprove of.<br /><br />I like this, as I am in favour of people adding more user-created metadata to their pages. It is a defence against a publicity attack &mdash; saying something outrageous to get a reaction &mdash; and that is why I prefer the <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/VoteLinks">Vote Link</a> categories of <code>vote-for</code>, <code>vote-against</code> and <code>vote-abstain</code> to the explicitly search-engine directed <code>nofollow</code>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html">Google's PageRank explanation</a> has long said: <blockquote>PageRank interprets a link from Page A to Page B as a vote for Page B by Page A.

  <span class="p-name">Tagging is for posts</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Over the past few days I've seen a lot of reaction to Technorati's new <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/tags" rel="tag">tags</a> feature. I hope to deal with the wider social networking, spam and ontological issues at a future date, but I'd like to have another go at clarifying the details of rel="tag" again, as if <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/18/TechnoTags">Tim Bray</a>, <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/01/16/technorati_tags_great_feature_please_remove_the_technorati_specific_url_add_ent_topicexchange_and_universal_category_support">Roland Tanglao</a> and <a href="http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/2005/01/18/TechnoratiTagAPIIsBroken">Kevin Burton</a> are all puzzled by it, we're obviously not conveying the idea clearly enough.<br /><br /><h4>It is not for tagging a URL.</h4>The new <code>rel="tag"</code> syntax we have proposed and adopted is attempting to solve a particular problem &mdash; how to tag web pages or blog posts.<br /><br />It seem that there <a href="http://www.peerfear.org/rss/permalink/2005/01/18/TechnoratiTagAPIIsBroken">is</a> <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/01/technorati_laun.html">demand</a> for a general decentralised syntax for tagging URLs, and that is certainly something to think about, but this is not meant for that. <br /><br /><h4>Tags do not require Technorati-proprietary URLs.</h4> The tag help pages on the Technorati site can be read in that way, but they are focused around linking to the pages themselves; the <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/RelTag">underlying specification</a> is clear that the url is to a 'tagspace' - a place that collates or defines tags. <br />I think this is an elegant way for the '<a href="http://technorati.com/tag/namespace" rel="tag">namespace</a>' discussion to be resolved - if there are colliding meanings for a tag, you can link to a disambiguating <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/tagspace" rel="tag">tagspace</a>, just as Tim describes.<br /><br /><h4>Tags are not invisible metadata.</h4> They are meant to be visible links on your page and in your posts. The 'this is just like meta keywords and will suffer the same death' argument misses this point.<br /><br />Part of the Google insight was that visible data is more trustworthy than invisible <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/metadata" rel="tag">metadata</a> - the links that people make visible on their pages are more part of their work than those they hide away for robots alone. Of course it doesn't make them immune to gaming, but it does make the gaming rather more obvious to human readers, especially to authors, who may not always be aware what invisible metadata is being generated on their behalf.<br /><br />Thus, the <code>&lt;link rel="tag" href="..." /&gt;</code> syntax is not read by the Technorati spider.<br /><br />This point is also behind some of the problems people have had with having their links picked up by the Technorati spiders - they sequester the tags away between posts, and omit them from their feeds. We're working hard on improving our tag detection (and many thanks to people who have spent time going back and forth on this with us, especially <a href="http://climbtothestars.org">Stephanie</a>), but we do expect them to be part of the post body.<br /><br />I hope this makes more sense now; we'll continue updating the formal spec and discussion pages in the light of this feedback.

  <span class="p-name">Welcome, Google. Seriously.</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  The <code>rel="nofollow"</code> initiative <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">spearheaded by Matt and Jason at Google</a> is a welcome step in helping webpage authors give semantic hints to search engines. <br />I first <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_03_01_epeus_archive.html#90699163">wrote about this in March 2003</a>, suggesting a way to link while expressing endorsement, neutrality or approval, and cited some previous suggestions there. This became the <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/VoteLinks">Vote Links specification</a> later, which has been supported by <a href="http://www.technorati.com/live/votes.html">Technorati</a> for a while, and it is great to see Google, Yahoo and MSN picking up on this idea.<br /><br />Since Wednesday morning, the Technorati spiders have been respecting the <code>rel="<a href="http://technorati.com/tag/nofollow" rel="tag">nofollow</a>"</code> attribute on links, along with <code>rel="<a href="http://technorati.com/tag/VoteLinks" rel="tag">vote-abstain</a>"</code> and <code>rel="vote-against"</code>, excluding these links from Authority counts, and Cosmos searches (we've seen just over a thousand <code>nofollow</code>s so far).<br /><br />I've taken the liberty of <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/RelNoFollow">drafting a more formal specification for the nofollow rel attribute,</a> and I trust we can submit this to a suitable standards body in future. <br /><br />I'd also like to second <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000272.html">Dave's call for a Spam Squashing Summit</a>, as there are many other sources of <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/spamsummit" rel="tag">spam</a> in blogs and elsewhere on the web.<br />

  <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/01/14#When:5:47:51AM">Dave said:</a><blockquote>tell us how you support open protocols and we'll figure out how to plug you in.&#160;</blockquote><br />We use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rel">existing HTML standard <code>rel</code> attribute</a> for link relationships and add a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.12">link type</a> <code>"tag"</code>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/01/dear_technorati.html">Niall said:</a><blockquote>Adding rel="tag" to any link should be enough to build a tag library for links off the link text. Technorati instead grabs the last part of the URL after the "/" and treats it as a post tag. I was hoping for a decentralized del.icio.us implementation.</blockquote><br />This is a misunderstanding of what <code>rel</code> on a link means. It defines a relationship between the page containing the link and the linked page. We have defined a new value <code>"tag"</code> which means 'treat the linked page as a category tag'. It is the link itself that has meaning here, not the link text you use. <br /><br />If you use the pages at <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/">http://technorati.com/tag/</a> as your destination, we know what this means. You could also use another domain that has tag-specific urls, like flickr, del.icio.us, or wikipedia. The assumption the technorati spider makes is that the last path component of the url is the tag, so <code>http://apple.com/ipod</code> would even work.<br /><br />We think that linking to our tag collator is a useful thing to do here, but they are your links and you can do as you wish. <br /><br />This was never meant to be a replacement for delicious, but a complement to it. del.icio.us is a great way to label links with tags. The new rel="tag" enables you to label your own blog posts with tags.

  The CBS memos case known as 'Rathergate' has been picked over for months in the blog world, so it was a bit of a surprise to me that <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2005_01_10.html#008853">only now have CBS issued their report</a>.<br /><br />When told that the memos were fake, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24633-2004Sep15.html">Rather said</a> "If the documents are not what we were led to believe, I'd like to break that story."

Presumably other big media organisations. <br /><br />More reflective journalists, such as <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots">Dan Gillmor</a>, are instead thinking how they can put INCLUSIVE on their stories - they are measuring success by how many people they bring into the conversation, and they recognise it doesn't necessarily start with them.<br /><br />Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Big+Media" rel="tag">Big Media</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/citizen+journalist" rel="tag">Citizen Journalist</a>

  <span class="p-name">Gillmor gets Hayekian</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  In <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/01/distributed_jou.html">Distributed Journalism's Future, Dan Gillmor says</a>:<blockquote><p>In <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/01/delay_rule_over.html">a posting</a> yesterday about how bloggers helped keep the pressure on U.S. House Republicans to reconsider an ethical issue, I mentioned the way two bloggers convinced average citizens to call their members of Congress and ask how they'd voted on the issue (it was a secret ballot). The inquiring citizens then let one of the bloggers know, and he posted the running results of the tally.</p><p>I said this was an example of something I'm calling "distributed journalism." <a href="http://www.chrisnolan.com/">Chris Nolan</a> called today to ask what I meant by this, and here's some of what I told her. (Here's her <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1748637,00.asp">eWeek story</a> on the subject.)</p><p>I think of distributed journalism as somewhat analogous to any project or problem that can be broken up into little pieces, where lots of people can work in parallel on small parts of the bigger question and collectively &mdash; and relatively quickly &mdash; bring to bear lots of individual knowledge and/or energy to the matter. Some open-source software projects work this way. The important thing is the parallel activity by large numbers of people, in service of something that would be difficult if not impossible for any one or small group of them to do alone, at least in a timely way.</p></blockquote>This is a very good summary of <a href="http://www.ertnet.demon.co.uk/2kinds.html">Hayek's 'spontaneous order' idea</a> &mdash; that individuals acting independently can achieve more precisely because they are working parallel on their own goals. Dan's 'people versus government' subtext here is an interesting aspect of this, reminding me of <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_11_01_epeus_archive.html#106812371392494147">Jane Jacobs' 'Two moralities'</a> too. <blockquote><p>Suppose, for example, that we assemble a nationwide group of volunteers &mdash; lawyers who are familiar with statutes &mdash; and ask each of them to take a small section of one of those immense congressional bills that the members of Congress don't even read themselves. Suppose, further, that we could get this analysis posted before the House and Senate did their final votes. We might catch a lot of sleazy stuff <em>before</em> it became law. Today we're lucky if we know about any of it before it actually passes.</p></blockquote>This is promising, but it is still a bit too top-down and hierarchical &mdash; someone in the middle is parcelling out the bills to lawyers to analyse, and somehow has to match each lawyers expertise with a legislative area. There is a better way, and <a href="http://taubz.for.net/">Joshua Tauberer</a> has already built it. <br /><a href="http://www.govtrack.us/">govtrack.us collates all US Government bills</a> into a more readable form than the official sites, and it also collates and adds weblog comments on each bill <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h108-4077">(see the sidebar on this copyright bill)</a>. This way we don't need a central co-ordinator, we just need to encourage lawyers, or indeed other citizens, to review bills that they have expertise or interest in, and blog the results with a link.

  <span class="p-name">Semantics in translation</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Finding translations of foreign writing can be tricky. <br /><a href="http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/a_minimal_step_.html">Tim Oren writes a requirements list</a>:<blockquote>[...]a small and pragmatic first step towards the inter-language blogosphere I've been writing about recently. Specifically, the idea of an RSS tag or something of the sort that would denote posts saying the same thing in different tongues, and be bait for aggregators and crawlers interested in that information.</blockquote>This set off my <a href="http://tantek.com/presentations/20040928sdforumws/semantic-xhtml.html">semantic XHTML</a> radar. Surely we can express this with a <code>rel</code> attribute on a link? <br />A quick rummage finds me <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-links">existing specification text at w3c</a>:<blockquote><dl><dt><strong>Alternate</strong></dt><dd>Designates substitute versions for the document in which the link occurs. When used together with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#adef-lang"><code>lang</code></a> attribute, it implies a translated version of the document. </dd></dl></blockquote> <br />Lets see how this fits in with Tim's list:<blockquote><b>Quicky Requirements</b><br /><ul><li>Need both TRANSLATES and TRANSLATED-BY flavors. Since the former can be spoofed, the latter form embedded in the original doc will have more credibility.</li></ul></blockquote>Bidirectional links can affirm an authoritative translation, as in <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/11#me">XFN's <code>me</code> attribute</a>. We could perhaps add a <code>original</code> and <code>translation</code> values for <code>rel</code> if we define a new profile.<blockquote><ul><li>Need Source and Target URLs. Should be able to point at whole docs or tagged spans (posts) within docs. Arbitrary linkage problematic due to limits of good ol' HTML.</li></ul></blockquote>The <code>rel</code> does this, with an implicit reference to the document you are reading. If you want subsections a <code>&lt;blockquote cite="..."&gt;</code> could be used.<blockquote><ul><li>Source and Target languages, in ISO-639.2</li></ul></blockquote>The <code>lang</code> does this, in the head of the document you are reading, and as an attribute on the link.<blockquote><ul><li>Translation type: Manual, Automatic. More flavors?</li><li>Translation authority: Who or what did it. What existing designators can be coopted?</li><li>Translation time and date stamp, and perhaps an MD-5 hash of the original. This is a placeholder for the whole versioning can o' worms. If the original is edited or updated, we have a state consistency problem...</li></ul></blockquote>These belong as metadata in the translated document, probably as explicit human readable text. The XOXO definition list model might be useful here.<blockquote><ul><li>Should do something useful in contemporary browsers, shouldn't be relying on having RSS readers/aggregators available in all target languages</li></ul></blockquote>Well, exactly. That is the whole point of semantic XHTML. You can deploy all this today. Please do!

  Here's a nice simple idea for any company that does online route-finding - create a version that finds routes optimised for cyclists or pedestrians.<br />I realise this will complicate your routing algorithms that seem to be 'head for the nearest freeway as soon as possible', but cyclists and pedestrians have different needs:<br /><ul><li>Prefer roads with cycle paths and pavements (sidewalks)</li><br /><li>Take steepness into consideration as well as distance (this one is specially true for San Francisco</li><br /><li>Allow for short-cuts through alleys and going the wrong way up one-way streets</li><br /><li>Show contour lines or gradient markers</li><br /><li>For extra credit, link in public transport timetables - especially ones that carry bikes</li><br /></ul><br />Go on <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com">Jeremy</a>, see if <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com">Yahoo maps</a> can do this for us.

  <span class="p-name">A strange view of reality</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/why_long_tail_c.html">Chris Anderson</a> passes on this <cite>David Foster Wallace</cite> quote:<br /><blockquote>TV is not vulgar and prurient and dumb because the people who compose the audience are vulgar and dumb. Television is the way it is simply because people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests.</blockquote><br />This is partly true, but I think there is something else going on too - the reality TV explosion is more than just chasing ratings through prurience. When I look at most reality TV shows, I am reminded of Greek mythology. The TV network looks down from Olympus, and plucks some ordinary mortal from obscurity, and gets him to do strange things for our amusement, unsure whether he'll see a shower of gold or be chained to a rock for eternity.<br /><br />I think that the reality TV trend plays to the networks' need to feel powerful, and as they lose the wholesale power of swaying opinion and determining conversation topics, they reach for the power over individuals in a more direct and insidious way.<br /><br />The notion of 'reality TV' bears some examination - 'reality' apparently consists of obeying arbitrary and complex rules, lying to your family or backstabbing your competitors, twisting the truth to put you in the best possible light in the rare hope of getting a million dollars instead of them. Anyone who has been through the TV commissioning process will see where this model of reality comes from.<br /><br />Of course, this just suggests a few more possible reality shows:<br /><ul><li>Sisyphus rocks</li><br /><li>Augean stable hand</li><br /><li>Pandora's dilemma - "take the money", "open the box"</li><br /><li>Blind Date with Zeus - what animal will you get?</li><br /></ul>

  <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/print/0,15935,724626,00.html">Fortune.com</a>: <blockquote>Harder to fathom is the MSN TV 2 Player's inability to play music that has been downloaded through a PC from MSN's own Music Store. The Player had no problem with PC-created MP3 files and tunes ripped into the Windows Media Audio format from CDs but choked on music bought from MSN itself. An MSN representative said the incompatibility arises from the digital rights management (DRM) copy-protection system employed by the MSN Music Store to fend off pirates.</blockquote>

  <span class="p-name">For the Fallen</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  For Remembrance Day, I have a special audioblog. This is <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/fallen.m4a"><cite>Laurence Binyon</cite>, reading For The Fallen</a> from the British Library's splendid collection <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0712305173/epeusepigone-20">The Spoken Word &#8211; Poets</a> <br /><blockquote> With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children, <br /> England mourns for her dead across the sea. <br /> Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit, <br /> Fallen in the cause of the free. <br /> <br /> Solemn the drums thrill; Death august and royal <br /> Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres, <br /> There is music in the midst of desolation <br /> And a glory that shines upon our tears. <br /> <br /> They went with songs to the battle, they were young, <br /> Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow. <br /> They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted; <br /> They fell with their faces to the foe. <br /> <br /> They shall not grow old, as we that are left grow old: <br /> Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. <br /> At the going down of the sun and in the morning <br /> We will remember them. <br /> <br /> They mingle not with their laughing comrades again; <br /> They sit no more at familiar tables of home; <br /> They have no lot in our labour of the day-time; <br /> They sleep beyond England's foam. <br /> <br /> But where our desires are and our hopes profound, <br /> Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight, <br /> To the innermost heart of their own land they are known <br /> As the stars are known to the Night; <br /> <br /> As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust, <br /> Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain; <br /> As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness, <br /> To the end, to the end, they remain.</blockquote>

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p><a href="http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2004/10/drm_as_business.html">Tim Oren writes on DRM as a warning sign</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Copy protection DRM always destroys end user value, in both convenience and robustness. When you see DRM in a business plan or analysis, it is always there to benefit someone other than the end user. Find out who, it will indicate where power lies in a content value chain.</p><p>The mere presence of DRM indicates a failure to deliver end user value. If the information object were to lose value when extracted from the bundle or service from it was derived, DRM would not be felt necessary. Therefore the presence of DRM suggests a vendor that is behind the curve, failing to find a new value to deliver as their chokepoint disappears in the digital world.</p></blockquote><p>Tim is correct that DRM destroys value, but he is mistaken in his implication that it can just be Customer value that is destroyed. The 0th law of economics is that a trade only happens when both parties see themselves as gaining from it. If the Customers see less value, they pay less for the product, and its value is thereby reduced. This kind of short-sightedness is foolish enough with conventional goods, but is especially stupid with digital media, when you have no measurable marginal cost of goods and can carry over Customers' excitement into other goods.</p>

TiVo collects data on which programs have been watched, which bits were fast-forwarded, and which were played more than once or in slow motion.<br />Imagine if it took something like the Olympics, or a baseball or football game, and collated everyone's replay speeds, and then offered up various highlights packages- the most viewed 5 minutes; most viewed hour and so on. This would naturally edit out all commercials, and the commentators padding, and show which bits of action people as a whole found interesting.</p>

  <span class="p-name">Losing language sales</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>This weekend we attended the Home School Geography Club, which was about Viet Nam, and enjoyed it immensely. Our friends the Hamiltons hosted it and, among many other fascinating things, taught us as few words in Vietnamese, and fed us Ph&#244; .<br />However when writing out the Vietnamese sheets, Bich was adding the accents by hand on the printout. It turns out that the Vietnamese keyboard inclued with OS X is far too hidden for anyone but experts to find(System Preferences, International, Input Menu Tab, and check the ones you want in a scrolling list).</p><p>This reminded me of an idea I had for an Apple ad campaign to highlight OS X's language support.</p><p>What I suggest is a poster campaign, showing a localised Mac screen running Mail with large type saying <blockquote><span style="font-size:18pt;">Macintosh speaks your languages</blockquote>Except that you do it as a teaser. </p><p>Start with the least common (in the US) languages Apple localises to, eg Korean, and work your way up the demographic to English, changing posters once a week or more often<br /><blockquote><span style="font-family:AppleGothic;font-size:24pt;">&#47588;&#53416;&#53664;&#49884;&#45716;</span><span style="font-size:24pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:AppleGothic;font-size:24pt;">&#45320;&#51032;</span><span style="font-size:24pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:AppleGothic;font-size:24pt;">&#50616;&#50612;&#47484;</span><span style="font-size:24pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:AppleGothic;font-size:24pt;">&#47568;&#54620;&#45796;</span><span style="font-family:AppleGothic;font-size:16pt;"><br /></span><span style="font-family:STHeiti;font-size:24pt;">&#12510;&#12483;&#12461;&#12531;&#12488;&#12483;&#12471;&#12517;&#12399;&#35328;&#35486;&#12434;&#35441;&#12377;</span><span style="font-family:AppleGothic;font-size:16pt;"><br /></span><span style="font-size:18pt;">Macintosh </span><span style="font-family:AppleGothic;font-size:18pt;">&#1075;&#1086;&#1074;&#1086;&#1088;&#1080;&#1090;</span><span style="font-size:18pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:AppleGothic;font-size:18pt;">&#1074;&#1072;&#1096;&#1080;</span><span style="font-size:18pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:AppleGothic;font-size:18pt;">&#1103;&#1079;&#1099;&#1082;&#1080;</span><span style="font-size:18pt;"><br />Macintosh fala suas l&#237;nguas<br />Macintosh spricht Ihre Sprachen<br />Macintosh parle vos langages<br />Macintosh habla sus lenguajes<br />Macintosh speaks your languages<br /></span></blockquote></p><p>Each time you change a poster and add a language, you switch the outer UI (menus etc) to that language. You deliberately place the posters in non-ethnic areas, so they are cryptic to most.<br />(Obviously, you get native speakers to translate the slogan instead of using Sherlock like I did).<br /><br />47 million Americans speak a non-English language, according to the 2000 Census. 26 million also speak English well, 21 million are less proficient. Millions more learn a foreign language in school.<br /><br />Imagine the media buzz these cryptic posters would generate, and the feeling of pride the bilingual people would have when they see an ad in their language, out in public.<br />In other countries, you do the same thing with a different language order.</p>

  Tomorrow night, <a href="http://tantek.com/log">Tantek</a> and I are <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/SDForum/Templates/CalendarEvent.aspx?CID=1524">talking at SDForum about Semantic XHTML</a>: <br /> <br /><h4>Can your website be your API? - Using semantic XHTML to make your structures clear</h4> <br />XML formats gained popularity as a backlash against the messiness of HTML mixing structure and presentation, and leniency for sloppy markup. With XHTML+CSS now widely supported in mainstream browsers, and gaining converts even amongst those most focused on representation, these objections lose their force, and the resistance to more and more ad-hoc specialized schemas grows. How far can we get specifying structure in pure XHTML -valid XML - styling it with CSS for presentation, and making it parsable for meaning? <br /> <br />

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>We went to <a href="http://www.mbayaq.org/">Monterey Bay Aquarium</a> on Sunday and saw the <a href="http://www.mbayaq.org/cr/whiteshark.asp">baby Great White shark</a> they have in the tank there - video below:</p><br /><object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B" width="320" height="256" codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab"<param name="src" value="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/shark.mov"><param name="autoplay" value="false"><param name="controller" value="true"><embed src="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/shark.mov" width="320" height="256" autoplay="false" controller="true" pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"></embed></object><br /><p>They say this is the only Great White to eat in captivity, and that the longest any lasted previously was 16 days. How annoying for the Bond villains with the shark tanks to have to restock every couple of weeks, and then to have the sharks refuse to eat when they drop victims in. </p><br /><p>The tip if you go to see it is to go in the Members' entrance (membership is a good deal if you go even twice a year) and go straight to the 'Endangered Wildlife' section, which leads to the bottom of the Outer Bay tank, where the shark spends its time. If you go upstairs to the auditorium seating part of the Outer Bay tank upstairs you are very unlikely to see the shark clearly past the crowds. </p>

  <a href="http://diveintomark.org">Mark Pilgrim</a>'s <a href="http://diveintopython.org">Dive Into Python</a> is now available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590593561/ref%3Dnosim/epeusepigone-20"> in book form </a>. Reading it in print reminded me how good it was, and it has grown a few chapters since I first read it online. <br /> <br />If an aversion to reading online has kept you back, go buy it now. It is a very impressive piece of work - it manages to explain the Python language, and, more importantly the idioms and customs of Python programming, through a series of well-chosen and interesting examples. The <a href="http://diveintopython.org/unit_testing/index.html">chapter on test-driven development </a> shows why this makes sense, how Python supports it, and how it leads to better code. <br /> <br />Mark writes as he does - look at his excellent <a href="http://feedparser.org">Universal Feed Parser,</a> with its <a href="http://feedparser.org/tests/">thousands of test cases</a> for a concrete example of the power of test-driven development. <br /> <br />Python is my favorite programming language.

  <span class="p-name">Call Off the Search</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Explaining Technorati and blogging to people has been tricky. Once I explain we keep track of what people are saying and linking to in weblogs, their first reaction is to say 'Oh you're a search engine' (silent subtext: Google will eat you for breakfast).<br />This is where it gets tricky, because search is a task, not a goal. <br /><a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000722.php"> Jeff Bezos and John Battelle</a> help explain this better:<br /><blockquote>[Bezos uses] "discovery" as an umbrella term which incorporates search. I think in the end when I use the word "search" I really mean "discovery" as Jeff uses it. What's discovery? Well, much more in the book, but in the end, it's search plus what happens when the network finds things for *you* - based on what it knows of you, your actions, and your inferred intent.</blockquote ><br />Last week I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x51L6hbIxr4&t=64m">Steve Jobs explain Technorati's advantage over Google</a> - he was talking about Safari's RSS search, but Technorati searches millions of blogs for you within minutes of them updating, not just the RSS feeds you have already subscribed to.<br /><br />But again, searching for keywords is missing the point. <br /><br />The great thing about weblogs is when you discover someone. Someone who makes sense to you, or someone who surprises you with a viewpoint you hadn't thought of. Once you have found them you can subscribe to their feeds and see how they can keep inspiring or surprising you. <br />You can even start a blog, link to them, and join the conversation,<br />The continuity of viewpoint within a blog is key - you can see more about them than just the one comment, and you can keep discovering and growing with them. Conversely, being aware that what you are writing is 'on your permanent record' means that you write more carefully for a blog than for an email.<br /><br /><a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/06/29/133454.php">Blogcritics sent me a CD to review</a> - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000255LB6/epeusepigone-20">Call Off the Search by Katie Melua</a>. <a href="http://maryanning.blogspot.com/2004/07/call-off-search_108916325457984851.html">Rosie loved it</a>, but the title song sums up what I'm getting at here: "Now that I've found you I'll call off the search."<br /> <br />Blogging is about what you discover, not about what you search for.<br />How you can follow the conversations and make new discoveries is what I'm working on. [updated 2014 - original Steve Jobs link was broken 5 times over by Apple: it linked to homepage.mac.com (Which they killed) hosting a Quicktime reference movie (which they killed) to a streaming Quicktime movie (which they killed) of a Steve Jobs keynote (which is now offline) explaining Safari RSS search (Which they killed).

  <span class="p-name">Citation and deep linking</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.yarinareth.net/caveatlector/archive/week_2004_06_06.html#e003058">Dorothea points out some problems around piecemeal citation:</a><br /><blockquote>[...] there&rsquo;s no automated way to add callouts to one individual paragraph without adding callouts to all of them.<br /><br />A more subtle explication of the problem: I could, if I chose, add individual id attributes to paragraphs on CavLec I thought especially worthy of notice. But who&rsquo;s to say that my idea of noteworthy paragraphs meshes with any other blogger&rsquo;s? Nobody, that&rsquo;s who. (Not least because it&rsquo;s an open question whether any paragraphs on CavLec are noteworthy.) The only way to ensure that anyone who wants to link to noteworthy paragraphs can do so is to assume that all paragraphs are potentially noteworthy.<br /><br />Worse, even if I do add id attributes, there&rsquo;s no way for a would-be linker to get at them for linking purposes except by inspecting my HTML code. Green hash marks may be crufty, but they address a genuine issue, one we might call &ldquo;identifier invisibility.&rdquo;<br /></blockquote ><br />The way around this is to do what I just did - copy in the piece you are citing and link to the whole. It's a little cumbersome, but it has the benefit of resilience (the original might vanish or be re-edited). A way to take this technique further is to use QuickTopic Document Review, as I did for <a href="http://akma.disseminary.org">AKMA's</a><a href="http://www.quicktopic.com/26/D/aZaPhibbvPYr?inline=1"> speech</a> for example. This both adds the paragraph citation links, enables inline comments, and archives a copy of the cited source elsewhere, protecting against it changing or vanishing and thus invalidating the citation link.<br /><br />This is the same issue as discussed by <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/05/18.html#a1003">Jon Udell last month for MP3's</a>.<br />If you want to cite an MP3 in a stable way, you can do it by copying a fragment and saving it locally, and linking back to the original source file. We don't try to dynamically insert chunks of text from other people's servers into the middle of our prose; why do it for media?<br />What is missing here is the rich media equivalent of QuickTopic Document Review, which mirrors media and adds annotation. Building something to enable this would be a fine project for the Internet Archive.

  <span class="p-name">Dashboard is nice, but how DO I make Safari sidebars?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_06.html#005887">Dave Hyatt said something interesting about the new dashboard widgets:</a><br /><blockquote>Just to prove a point that there are many ways to think about this new feature, here's another take on what Dashboard is. From a browser geek's perspective, the Dashboard is a collection of HTML sidebar panels liberated from the browser window and placed anywhere on your screen. The "Web pages as widgets" concept is really just a logical extension of the Web sidebar panel metaphor fused with Exposé.[...]<br />However the sidebar metaphor suffers from usability problems, such as the inability to scale up to many panels as well as being constrained by the browser's window width. It's also hard to view multiple panels at once. The panels are also tied to a particular application (the browser) despite frequently having no connection to the application itself.</blockquote><br /><br />Which makes sense for sidebars that are decoupled from the current page context. However, what is missing here (and as far as I could tell at WWDC last week, is not available at all in Safari) is a way to put a sidebar in the browser that is informed by the page context therein and can interact with it. As Hyatt says, this is possible in IE on Windows, and in Mozilla derivatives. Can we do this within Safari, using Dashboard or AppleScript, or anything other then hacking the nibs inside Safari itself?

  <span class="p-name">DropDV: Convert MPEG to DV</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  More than 10 years ago, Apple added MPEG playback to QuickTime. In order to work around QuickTime not having support for bi-directional difference frames, and some issues with MPEG's format being a bitstream rather than a byte stream, this was done my making it a special media type rather than showing up as separate video and audio tracks. As a side effect of this, exporting audio from MPEG movies didn't work. This was one of those features that was annoying to few enough people and just enough work that it has been continually deferred from release to release (hey, I spent 6 years there and never got to it either). There have been MPEG stream manipulation tools from Sparkle onwards, but they have always needed a deep understanding of the format, a degree in computer science and lots of patience to use. <br />Now that there are video cameras and digital cameras that record MPEG directly, this is suddenly a lot more annoying, but fortunately there is an answer: <br /><a href="http://www.dropdv.com/">DropDV: Convert MPEG to DV</a>: <cite>DropDV is a Mac OS X droplet which converts MPEG video into DV video streams. This allows the video to be edited in iMovie, Premiere, Final Cut, or any other DV video editing system. <br />Features <br />Handles both video and audio <br />Uses high quality bicubic scaling for the best video image <br />Decodes in YUV color space, other tools use RGB. <br />Supports both NTSC and PAL output <br />A Simple, drag-and-drop interface</cite>

This time it must of its nature be an imaginary one. I am going to translate a passage of good English into modern English of the worst sort. Here is a well-known verse from Ecclesiastes: <br /><blockquote>I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</blockquote> <br />Here it is in modern English: <br /><blockquote>Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.</blockquote> <br />This is a parody, but not a very gross one. [...] It will be seen that I have not made a full translation. The beginning and ending of the sentence follow the original meaning fairly closely, but in the middle the concrete illustrations -- race, battle, bread -- dissolve into the vague phrases "success or failure in competitive activities." This had to be so, because no modern writer of the kind I am discussing -- no one capable of using phrases like "objective considerations of contemporary phenomena" -- would ever tabulate his thoughts in that precise and detailed way. The whole tendency of modern prose is away from concreteness. </div>

  <span class="p-name">Black, White, Grey and mediAgora</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I know I've been quiet on the <a href="http://mediagora.com">mediAgora</a> front recently, but the <a href="http://www.greytuesday.org/">Grey Album</a> case is in many ways a perfect example of the mediAgora principle of rewarding Creators of both derivative and original works. <br /> <br />Imagine, if you will, a parallel universe where The Beatles 'White Album' and Jay-Z's 'Black Album' had been released under mediAgora licences. <br /> <br />Along comes Danger Mouse, and mixes the two to make the 'Grey Album', and releases it for sale under a mediAgora license too. <br /> <br />So what happens? <br /> <br />He list both monochromatic albums as 'source works'. Everyone who buys 'The Grey Album' has to own a copy of the two source albums too. If they already do, they just pay Danger Mouse; if they own The Beatles but not Jay-Z they pay him and Danger Mouse. <br /> <br />As DM is generating incremental sales in this way, he gets promotion fees from the other two. <br /> <br />And all those bloggers pointing to the Grey Album? They get promotion fees from Danger Mouse, insofar as they generate sales (and have bought a copy themselves). <br /> <br />End result - every Customer has 3 great albums, and all Creators involved get paid the price they set. <br /> <br />And even Glenn Miller and the orchestras George Martin and the Beatles sampled could be rewarded too.

  <span class="p-name">Technorati, Xanadu and other dreams</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2004/02/11.html#a547">Tim Oren says nice things about Technorati</a>:<br /><blockquote>As we all know, Ted Nelson meant hypertexts to have bidirectional links. But due to a laboratory accident in Switzerland, we ended up with this lame thing. Mechanisms such as Google link search and Technorati are just hacks, ways to leverage Moore's Law to ameliorate a fundamental flaw in our hypertext data architecture, crawling the Web faster and faster to aggregate all of our trackbacks.<br /><br />Yesterday, David Sifry convinced me that's just wrong. What Nelson missed, with his focus on 'literary' architectures, is that networked hypertexts are inhabited by people. Links are not just citations. They are gestures in a social space, parts of conversations or other interactions. There's an inherent value in looking at the dynamics of the record as it is created.</blockquote><br /><br />Obviously I agree with the broad thrust of this or wouldn't be working at Technorati. However, I think the one-way nature of links was necessary for the Web to achieve what it did. The globally connected nature of the web as a small world network is built on a scale-free distribution of linkage. If all links are required to be two-way, this rapidly becomes unwieldy and cumbersome - imagine if the front page of Apple.com showed <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/links.html?url=http://www.apple.com/">all the inbound links to it</a>. The unidirectionality created the permission-free linking culture the web depends on, and reversing those links in a useful way is an interesting problem we're having fun solving - the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/products.html">hot products page</a> is an example of this.<br /><br />In fact, that page addresses another issue, if obliquely. <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/connecting/community_member_or_writer.htm">Shelley asked how being a community member affects your writing:</a><br /><blockquote> [W]eblogging [is] different than Big Media, because it puts publishing in the hands of the people. I have to presume they think this is a good thing because webloggers can write what they want, and aren't censored. Unlike Big Media, we aren't accountable to an editor, or big companies, or important politicians.<br /><br />But I guess we're accountable to each other, and that's the most dangerous censorship of all -- it's the censorship of the commons.</blockquote><br /><br />Indeed. I think this is a good thing. The fact that when blogging we are accountable for our writings and their public history acts, in general, in a good way - it makes us stop to think about our reactions before they 'end upon our permanent record'. Shelley's own campaign against comment spammers that violate community norms in this way is an example. <a href="http://hyperorg.com/blogger/">David Weinberger</a> in 'Small Pieces Loosely Joined' put it this way:<br /><blockquote>A human being raised in isolation would not be identifiably human in anything except DNA. Sociality grants a mute herd of brutes their souls and selves. </blockquote><br /><br />The example of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/14/technology/14AMAZ.html?ex=1392094800&en=183dc1d16a0c7b4c&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">what happens when anonymity is allowed in Amazon reviews, leading to all kinds of dubious behaviour</a> was revealed in the NYT , and picked up by auctorial bloggers like <a href="http://boingboing.net/2004_02_01_archive.html#107673517839075979">Cory</a> and <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2004_02_08_archive.asp#107678834795958113">Neil Gaiman</a>. The bloggers' comments show up in context with the rest of their writings, so you can gather whether you are likely to agree with them generally too.<br /><br />For example, when <a href="http://www.errant.org/lago/archives/001030.html">Lago attacks Vote Links for reinforcing hegemony</a> I can see that he is the same person who threatened to offer Joi a reading list, but then didn't, so I can offer him one instead:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226320863/epeusepigone-20"><img src="http://mediagora.com/books/hayek1.jpg" border="0" alt="Hayek: Law, Legislation and Liberty I" hspace="3" vspace="3" /></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738205435/epeusepigone-20"><img src="http://mediagora.com/books/splj.jpg" border="0" alt="Small Pieces Loosely Joined" hspace="3" vspace="3" /></a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465039138/epeusepigone-20"><img src="http://mediagora.com/books/code.jpg" border="0" alt="Code and other laws of Cyberspace" hspace="3" vspace="3" /></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609809989/epeusepigone-20"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0609809989.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg" border="0" alt="Ubiquity" hspace="3" vspace="3" /></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060521996/epeusepigone-20"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0060521996.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg" border="0" alt="Ubiquity" hspace="3" vspace="3" /></a>

Imagine trying to apply any of those criticisms to what you hear on the telephone. Of course you can�t �trust� what people tell you on the web anymore than you can �trust� what people tell you on megaphones, postcards or in restaurants. Working out the social politics of who you can trust and why is, quite literally, what a very large part of our brain has evolved to do. For some batty reason we turn off this natural scepticism when we see things in any medium which require a lot of work or resources to work in, or in which we can�t easily answer back � like newspapers, television or granite. Hence �carved in stone.� What should concern us is not that we can�t take what we read on the internet on trust � of course you can�t, it�s just people talking � but that we ever got into the dangerous habit of believing what we read in the newspapers or saw on the TV � a mistake that no one who has met an actual journalist would ever make.

  I think these were explained by <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/metastuff/wonder/ch3.html">Lewis Carroll:</a> <br /><div class="cite">What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, `was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.' <br /> <br />`What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. <br /> <br />`Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.) <br /> <br />First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One, two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, `But who has won?' <br /> <br />This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'</div>

  <span class="p-name">Media Heresy: Compression is becoming redundant</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Yesterday, <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/">Ross</a> sent <a href="http://www.enterprisesoftwaresummit.com/bios/bfrancisco.htm">Bambi Francisco</a> to talk to me, and she asked an interesting question: "Is there a Moore's Law for compression?" My answer didn't all make it into <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B2A4EE12D%2DDAEB%2D4DE0%2DA604%2D2B873539FC5A%7D&siteid=mktw">her article,</a> so here is an expanded version for my 'media heresies' series. <br /> <br /><i>"Is there a Moore's Law for compression?"</i> <br />In the sense of compression getting uniformly better over time? No. <br />Compression has different constraints - it is primarily based around fooling human perception systems by sending less information. Compression generally has two phases - a lossy phase where the data is transformed into a less accurate version by exploiting limitations of human vision or hearing, and a lossless phase where redundancy is squeezed out mathematically (this phase is like using .zip). <br /> <br />With more computing power, more elaborate transformations can be done in the first phase, and more complex mathematical compression can take place in the second phase, and still give the computer enough time to achieve a useful frame rate, but overall compression standards do not improve at anything like Moore's Law speed. <br /> <br />I'd say video compression is maybe 2-4 times as efficient (in quality per bit) than it was in 1990 or so when MPEG was standardised, despite computing power and storage having improved a thousandfold since then. <br /> <br />However, what does happen is that the Moore's Law effects on computing power, and the Moore's Law cubed effect on storage capacity mean that compression becomes less relevant over time. <br /> <br />You can now buy an off-the shelf computer that can edit uncompressed High Definition TV for under 10% of the cost of an HD tapedeck. <br /> <br />Consider that the iPod has gone from 5GB to 40GB in under 18 months - a factor of 8. The MP3 compression iTunes uses is about 8:1, so that means you could fill the new iPod with uncompressed audio and store as much as you did in the old one. Apply that rate of doubling another few times and think about pocket TiVos. Farfetched? I'm not so sure - Computer users have been watching DVDs on laptops for a while now; hand-held DVD players are being bought for children in the backseat and people who travel. According to my friends at Best Buy, they sold out all the portable DVD players they had this Christmas - they had hit a sensible price point. <br /> <br />The deeper point is a trend based one. If storage continues to improve in capacity per dollar at 3 times the rate of computing power, compression becomes wholly redundant - the CPU running the bit-manipulation is the bottleneck. The HD editing computers work this way - they have DMA (direct memory access) hardware in the disk interface and the screen interface, and the computer's job is to get out of the way. <br /> <br />The other reason compression is a bad idea in the long run is precisely because of its success in removing redundancy. If you have uncompressed audio or video, a single bit error will likely go un-noticed. If you are unlucky and it is the high bit of a sample, you will get a transient click in the sound, or a brightly coloured dot in the wrong place in video, but it will soon pass and be covered by a correct bit. <br />If you have a single bit error in a compressed stream it will make the rest of the frame, or possibly many frames, corrupt. In the worst case it can destroy the rest of the file from then onwards. <br />For archival content this kind of fragility is not what you want.

  <span class="p-name">New model for music playlists</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  We were talking in #joiito about wanting to play music for each other, but not being able to just post urls to our mp3's for fear of vexatious prosecution. <br /> <br />So here's my initial straw man suggestion for how to do this. <br /> <br />1. create a new playist format that refers to songs by a canonical naming scheme - <a href="http://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> has a good starting point. These get put in URI's that look something like: <br /> <br />songid:66fea472-0093-4764-a574-7ef87ade4433?artistid=d1601842-8052-4ac1-81ef-67e8259250dd&artist=Shannon%20Campbell%20and%20Scott%20Andrew%20LePera&title=Nothing%20New <br /> <br />How does one resolve this URI? <br /> <br />Implement an app that tries several alternatives: <br />1. Is it in the local music collection? <br />2. Is it available on a label or artist website/bittorrent? <br />3. Is a promotional extract up on Amazon or iTunes store? <br />4. allow further plugins <br /> <br />In each case the name/title are used for an initial match, and the sing identification process defined by MusicBrainz used to be sure we have a real match.

If the ISPs continue to win these cases, then a major segment of the digital media value chain that could support DRM technologies and services may disappear. </div> <br /> <br />Remarkably honest reporting by DRM Watch here.

Most digital cameras only generate 8-bits per channel of dynamic range, and are still competing on resolution. <br />On the other hand, even the $30 scanners do 12-bits per channel these days, and 14-bits per channel (42-bit) are only about $50. <br /> <br />I expect that digital cameras will pick up on this soon, but we'll need a file-format change (and possibly a better transient storage device than flash memory) and new low-cost software to make it mainstream. Ironically, all the sophisticated exposure calculation that makes many digital cameras too slow to use for action snapshots could be reduced if they upped the dynamic range a few stops. <br /> <br />If you want to see what kinds of dynamic range digital photography is really capable of, have a look at the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/gallery/showcase/nebulae/index.shtml">Hubble images,</a> where every photon is carefully counted.

  <span class="p-name">The technical argument against DRM</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Although the economic argument is more powerful - that DRM destroys value for customers and hence will be shunned by them - the technical argument is strong too. <br />This rests on one of the fundamental pillars of Computer Science - the <a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church-Turing_thesis">Church Turing Thesis</a> that states that any computer can emulate any other. When this is combined with the continual improvement in computing power available, it means we will always be able to run old software, or indeed protected software, by emulating the environment it runs within. <br />Simson Garfinkel <a href="http://www.techreview.com/articles/wo_garfinkel120303.asp?p=0">describes how emulation saved the BBC Domesday Project</a>, the authors of which I worked with at the BBC and the MMC. <br /> <br />"But that wasn't DRM" I hear the cry, "just obsolete hardware and data formats". <br /> <br />How about a systematic program that defeats the hardware protection for pay per use interactive experiences that works in a general enough way to encompass 25 years worth of hardware design? <br /> <br />It's called <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> and it has just been <a href="http://ps2.consolevision.com/ngage/emame.shtml"> ported to the Nokia N-Gage </a> cellphone/game gadget. It has emulators for various CPUs (and graphics and sound chips) to run the code directly from the original game ROMs - they look and feel just like the real thing <br />If Nokia are smart they will license this and the games and use it to promote the gadget - <a href="http://www.starroms.com/">this company has licensed Atari ROMs for sale</a>. After all, those 80s games are smaller than most MMS photos that get sent, and they're lots more fun than ringtones. <br /> <br />I hope <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/"> Ed Felten </a> and maybe can explain this to the assembled lawyers at the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/ACSmeeting.html">Berkman conference today</a>. Most of them seem to like on <a href="http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/CompulsoryLicensing">compulsory licensing schemes</a>. <br />I wish I had been able to take the chance offered to join them and present <a href="http://mediagora">mediAgora</a> to them. I look forward to reading the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/cmusings/2003/12/04#a513">blogging of the event</a>. <br /> <br />Here's a cartoon I made with <a href="http://www.adgame-wonderland.de/type/bayeux.php">the wonderfully silly Bayeux Tapestry Construction Kit</a> <br /> <br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/doom.jpg" width=100% />

  <div class="e-content">
  
  Last week Dave Sifry and I met up with Dave Winer and Steve Gillmor at Technorati to share ideas. We talked about the public resource that Dave W created in weblogs.com, about Technorati, and about Dave's new idea to help people categorize blog postings and the things they link to. <br /><a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2003/11/30#When:4:07:16PM">Dave W said</a>: <i>I feel we're at a turning point in the weblog world, either we're going to be like every other hierarchy that's ever been, with secret deals, lots of impediments to progress, eventual stagnation; or we're going to overcome that.</i> <br /> <br />Dave thinks in hierarchies; whether this is <i>because</i> he invented outlining, or <i>why</i> he invented outlining I'm not sure. Along the way he added links into the picture, so his hierarchies can link to other nodes, or other hierarchies to get as complex as you like. <br /> <br />The conventional wisdom is that links beat out hierarchies - Google's link-centric approach beat out Yahoo's hierarchy-centric approach (the HO in Yahoo stood for Hierarchically Oriented). <br /> <br />However, another way of looking at it is <a href="http://www.ertnet.demon.co.uk/2kinds.html">top-down versus bottom-up</a> - central design versus emergence. <br /> <br />Dave W wants to build a bottom-up emergent taxonomy, using open debate and open standards. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1399496,00.asp">Steve Gillmor</a> is saying something similar about how we can grow new things. <br /> <br />I have a couple of ideas that I need to write up as spec proposals to try to start such discussions - one about 'vote links', one a new bit of metadata for feeds saying whether they are complete or not.

  <span class="p-name">iTunes Security blather</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.net4nowt.com/isp_news/news_article.asp?News_ID=1615"> Tracey Meyers</a> wins the most errors in the shortest amount of text award this week: <br /><i> "So sue me" stated young Norwegian hacker Jon Lech Johansen last week after he posted a program to crack iTunes air-tight security. <br /> <br />Johansen posted the program called "QTFairUse", with the previously mentioned quote, on his own website. The free software has the uncanny ability to sidestep iTunes anti-copying software, MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding that once installed illegally views protected music files in QuickTime without paying a fee or royalty.</i> <br /> <br />1) 'air-tight' security is remarkably meaningless. In fact, oscillating air is the primary security 'hole' in iTunes, followed closely by the built-in CD-burning code. <br />2) 'uncanny' is an odd thing to say about source code. It's pretty clear what he is doing if you can read C, and if you can't why not talk to someone who can first? <br />3) MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding is not anti-copying software, it is a compression format. The anti-copying stuff is called FairPlay. <br />4) That last sentence manages to call AAC illegal. <br />5) You can already listen to (not view, unless you count the tiny spectrum display) the protected music files in QT Player, as long as you know the username/password. <br />6) You have to have already paid for the music for this to work. All it does it replace the 'burn to CD' option with a less convenient way to extract the audio (It only works on one song at a time as it is played). <br />7) It's highly arguable that this is illegal, given that transferring music to other forms is explicitly legal - indeed were it not, the CD to MP3/AAC part of iTunes would be illegal. There may be a DMCA case on circumvention grounds here, but it isn't a good one, given the fact that iTunes will let you make CDs from the same file. In any case the DMCA is not Norwegian law. <br /> <br />Still, I'm surprised it took this long for someone to start the arms race in this instance. I hope my old friends in Apple don't get dragged into it.

  <span class="p-name">Co-opting the Future By�John C. Mahler</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Trolls, are all the rage in some quarters. We're told that trolls will evolve into a unique source of information and are sure to become the future of journalism. Well, hardly. Two things are happening to prevent such a future: The first is wholesale abandonment of troll sites, and the second is the casual co-opting of the troll universe by Big Media. <br /> <br />Let's start with abandoned trolls. Thanks to <a href="http://snopes.com">busy debunkers</a> trolling has got harder. <br /> <br />The most obvious reason for abandonment is simple boredom. Writing is tiresome. Why anyone would do it voluntarily on a troll mystifies a lot of professional writers. This is compounded by a lack of feedback, positive or otherwise. Perseus thinks that most trolls have an audience of about 12 readers. Leaflets posted on the corkboard at Albertsons attract a larger readership than many trolls. Some people must feel the futility. <br /> <br />The problem is further compounded by professional writers who promote trolling, with the thought that they are increasing their own readership. It's no coincidence that the most-read trolls are created by professional writers. They have essentially suckered thousands of newbies, mavens, and just plain folk into trolling, solely to get return links in the form of the blogrolls and citations. This is, in fact, a remarkably slick grassroots marketing scheme that is in many ways awesome, albeit insincere. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, at some point, people will realize they've been used. This will happen sooner rather than later, since many mainstream publishers now see the opportunity for exploitation. Thus you find professionally written and edited faux trolls appearing on MSNBC's site, the Washington Post site, and elsewhere. This seems to be where trolling is headed�Big Media. So much for the independent thinking and reporting that are supposed to earmark blog journalism. <br /> <br /> <br />So now we have the emergence of the professional troll working for large media conglomerates and spewing the same measured news and opinions we've always had�except for fake edginess, which suggests some sort of independent, counterculture, free-thinking observers. But who signs the checks? The faux troll will replace the old personality columns that were once the rage in newspaperdom. Can you spell retro? These are not the hard-hitting independent voices we were promised. They are just a new breed of columnist with a gimmick and a stern corporate editor. <br /> <br /> <br /> By� John C. Mahler <br /> <br />Previously by this author: <a href="http://gonzoengaged.blogspot.com/2002_04_14_gonzoengaged_archive.html">Deconstructing the Troll </a>

On November the 11th, my history teacher, Mr. Evans, came in wearing a red poppy, and noticing some of the white ones, scrapped his lesson plan and told us about the Somme. <br />The part that sticks with me is him saying "The machine guns on the front used soft lead bullets about 4 inches long. They flattened and spread out on impact, making a hole the size of a soup plate on the way out of the soldiers body. Money given for the red poppies goes to care for the soldiers who survived this."

The Internet Threat Model (ITM), in a nutshell. <br /> <br />It's a strong model: the end nodes are secure and the middle is not. It's clean, it's simple, and we just happen to have a solution for it. <br /> <br />Problem is, it's also wrong. The end systems are not secure, and the comms in the middle is actually remarkably safe. <br /> <br />(Whoa! Did he say that?) Yep, I surely did: the systems are insecure, and, the wire is safe. [...] <br /> <br />...in practice, we can conclude, nobody much listens to our traffic. Really, so close to nobody that nobody in reality worries about it. <br /> <br />But, every sumbitch is trying to hack into our machine, everyone has a virus scanner, a firewall, <br />etc etc. I'm sure we've all shared that weird feeling when we install a new firewall that notifies when your machine is being port scanned? <br />A new machine can be put on a totally new IP, and almost immediately, ports are being scanned....</i>

Here's what I was trying to say: <br />The net extends the range of the power law distribution. <br />If you look at relative popularity on the web, using something like Technorati, you get a power law curve that goes all the way down smoothly, to the bottom where you see pages that got just a single link. <br />If you look at popularity in the publishing world - movies, chart music or books - the curve starts out with a power law, but soon drops like a stone. <br />That's because in order to get a movie made, a recording contract or a book published, you have to convince somebody that you're going to sell a million tickets, a hundred thousand CDs or tens of thousands of books. <br />You end up in a zero-sum game, where people pour enormous resources into being number one, because number two is only half as good. The promise of the net is that the power of all those little links can outweigh the power of the top ten. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2003/10/24.html#a417">Tim Oren</a> is saying much the same thing, with a different metaphor. <br /> <br />Update: <br /><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/ml/output.pl/35510/stream/temp.ram">Hear my original comment</a>.

  A preliminary response to <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001058">Aaron</a> <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/lit/historical/DiaryofaPilgrimage/chap1.html">Diary of a Pilgrimage - Part I</a>: <br /><i>What a wonderful piece of Socialism modern civilisation has become!--not the Socialism of the so-called Socialists--a system modelled apparently upon the methods of the convict prison--a system under which each miserable sinner is to be compelled to labour, like a beast of burden, for no personal benefit to himself, but only for the good of the community--a world where there are to be no men, but only numbers--where there is to be no ambition and no hope and no fear,--but the Socialism of free men, working side by side in the common workshop, each one for the wage to which his skill and energy entitle him; the Socialism of responsible, thinking individuals, not of State-directed automata. <br /> <br />Here was I, in exchange for the result of some of my labour, going to be taken by Society for a treat, to the middle of Europe and back. Railway lines had been laid over the whole 700 or 800 miles to facilitate my progress; bridges had been built, and tunnels made; an army of engineers, and guards, and signal-men, and porters, and clerks were waiting to take charge of me, and to see to my comfort and safety. All I had to do was to tell Society (here represented by a railway booking-clerk) where I wanted to go, and to step into a carriage; all the rest would be done for me. Books and papers had been written and printed; so that if I wished to beguile the journey by reading, I could do so. At various places on the route, thoughtful Society had taken care to be ready for me with all kinds of refreshment (her sandwiches might be a little fresher, but maybe she thinks new bread injurious for me). When I am tired of travelling and want to rest, I find Society waiting for me with dinner and a comfortable bed, with hot and cold water to wash in and towels to wipe upon. Wherever I go, whatever I need, Society, like the enslaved genii of some Eastern tale, is ready and anxious to help me, to serve me, to do my bidding, to give me enjoyment and pleasure. Society will take me to Ober-Ammergau, will provide for all my wants on the way, and, when I am there, will show me the Passion Play, which she has arranged and rehearsed and will play for my instruction; will bring me back any way I like to come, explaining, by means of her guide-books and histories, everything upon the way that she thinks can interest me; will, while I am absent, carry my messages to those I have left behind me in England, and will bring me theirs in return; will look after me and take care of me and protect me like a mother--as no mother ever could. <br /> <br />All that she asks in return is, that I shall do the work she has given me to do. As a man works, so Society deals by him. <br /> <br />To me Society says: 'You sit at your desk and write, that is all I want you to do. You are not good for much, but you can spin out yards of what you and your friends, I suppose, call literature; and some people seem to enjoy reading it. Very well: you sit there and write this literature, or whatever it is, and keep your mind fixed on that. I will see to everything else for you. I will provide you with writing materials, and books of wit and humour, and paste and scissors, and everything else that may be necessary to you in your trade; and I will feed you and clothe you and lodge you, and I will take you about to places that you wish to go to; and I will see that you have plenty of tobacco and all other things practicable that you may desire--provided that you work well. The more work you do, and the better work you do, the better I shall look after you. You write--that is all I want you to do.' <br /> <br />'But,' I say to Society, 'I don't like work; I don't want to work. Why should I be a slave and work?' <br /> <br />'All right,' answers Society, 'don't work. I'm not forcing you. All I say is, that if you don't work for me, I shall not work for you. No work from you, no dinner from me--no holidays, no tobacco.' <br /> <br />And I decide to be a slave, and work. <br /> <br />Society has no notion of paying all men equally. Her great object is to encourage brain. The man who merely works by his muscles she regards as very little superior to the horse or the ox, and provides for him just a little better. But the moment he begins to use his head, and from the labourer rises to the artisan, she begins to raise his wages. <br /> <br />Of course hers is a very imperfect method of encouraging thought. She is of the world, and takes a worldly standard of cleverness. To the shallow, showy writer, I fear, she generally pays far more than to the deep and brilliant thinker; and clever roguery seems often more to her liking than honest worth. But her scheme is a right and sound one; her aims and intentions are clear; her methods, on the whole, work fairly well; and every year she grows in judgment. <br /> <br />One day she will arrive at perfect wisdom, and will pay each man according to his deserts. <br /> <br />But do not be alarmed. This will not happen in our time. </i> <br />

For example, the root of ongoing is at http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/, but there are things that are part of ongoing that don�t start with http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/ and there are things elsewhere on http://www.tbray.org/ that are part of other web sites.[...] <br /><b>Grabbing Pieces of Namespace Isn't OK</b> <br />Now, let's assume that we could somehow find the 'root' of a web site by some magic. I just don't think it's OK now in 2003, when we're maybe 1% of the way into the Web's lifespan, to start gobbling up little bits of the namespace. As it is, the names robots.txt and favicon.ico are stolen forever, nobody will ever be able to use them for their own purposes again.</i> <br /> <br />OK, so how about we go back to <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_10_01_epeus_archive.html#106586708938434181">Plan A</a> and define <a href="http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd.txt">DNS SRV records</a> for domains to point to these? <br /> <br />It is a way to avoid well known ports, and it could be a way to avoid well know relative URL's too.

The public is what we say to a crowd; the private is what we chatter amongst ourselves, when free from the demands of the crowd; and the secret is what we keep from everyone but our confidant. Secrecy implies intrigue, implies you have something to hide. Being private doesn't. You can have a private gathering, but it isn't necessarily a secret. All these conversations have different implications, different tones. <br /> <br />Most people have, in the back of their mind, the belief that what they say to their friends, they would be happy to say in public, in the same words. It isn't true, and if you don't believe me, tape-record yourself talking to your friends one day, and then upload it to your website for the world to hear. <br /> <br />This is the trap that makes fly-on-the-wall documentaries and reality TV so entertaining. It's why politicians are so weirdly mannered, and why everyone gets a bit freaked out when the videocamera looms at the wedding. It's what makes a particular kind of gossip - the 'I can't believe he said that!' - so virulent. No matter how constant a person you are, no matter how unwavering your beliefs, something you say in the private register will sound horrific, dismissive, egotistical or trite when blazoned on the front page of the Daily Mirror. This is the context that we are quoted out of. <br /> <br />But in the real world, private conversations stay private. Not because everyone is sworn to secrecy, but because their expression is ephemeral and contained to an audience. There are few secrets in private conversations; but in transmitting the information contained in the conversation, the register is subtly changed. I say to a journalist, 'Look, Dave, err, frankly the guy is a bit, you know. Sheesh. He's just not the sort of person that we'd ever approve of hiring.'. The journalist, filtering, prints, 'Sources are said to disapprove of the appointment.'</i> <br /> <br />Read the whole thing - it is deep stuff, I found to helped me think about this more clearly. <br /> <br />One of the reasons I find 'Trusted Computing' so mistaken is that it confuses the private and the secret, and tries to solve these problems of human trust and community with encryption technology. <br /> <br />Mediation via journalist is less useful than it was, especially given the <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/10/14#theGreatFrameup">the frames that they force us into</a>. <br />The semi-public voice of blogs is a new kind of mediation, and a promising one.

  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/33366.html">Andrew Orlowski</a>: <br /><i>Try <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=os+x+panther+discussion">OS X Panther Discussion</a> for size: it's a Google query for OS X Panther discussion. In what must be a record, Google is - at time of writing - returning empty Trackback pages as No.1, No.2, No.3 and No.4 positions. No.5 gets you to a real web page - an Apple Insider bulletin board. Then it's back to empty Trackback pages for results No.6, No.7 and No.10. In short, Google returns blog-infested blanks for seven of the top entries. </i> <br /> <br />Orlowski blames this on bloggers for corrupting PageRank. <br /> <br />He is wrong - this is a consequence of Google giving strong weight to the &lt;title&gt; tag, over and above the PageRank involved. I believe they did this to reduce the alleged blog pollution he rants about interminably.

  <span class="p-name">802.11 in the developing world</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I had a fascinating conversation with Bill Woodcock, who just got back from Tonga. Apparently in the developing world, 802.11 is taking over from GSM, as the access points are orders of magnitude cheaper. <br />Consequently, there are cellphones that run 802.11 and VoIP, but the customers don't know this, as the phones just work. <br /> <br />Routing round incumbent telcos this way is easier there - nations like Niu� and Tonga have open public wireless networks, and countries like Nigeria are growing urban-area wireless networks too, with huge zones bridging between basestations across town. <br /> <br />I was thinking the other day that for what I spend a month on cellphone services, I could buy a wireless basestation every month and put one every place I go.

You subscribe to the ones you find interesting.

  <span class="p-name">Sunncomm's death spiral</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I have often pointed out that Digital Rights Management is futile. It is ineffective, and destroys the value of the content that it supposedly protects. Suncomm have sunk to a new low here: <br /> <br /><a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1025_3-5089168.html?tag=nefd_top">News.com</a>: <br /><i>SunnComm Technologies, a developer of CD antipiracy technology, said Thursday that it will likely sue a Princeton student who early this week showed how to evade the company's copy protection by pushing a computer's Shift key. <br /> <br />Princeton Ph.D. student John 'Alex' Halderman published a paper on his Web site on Monday that gave detailed instructions on how to disarm the SunnComm technology, which aims to block unauthorized CD copying and MP3 ripping. The technology is included on an album by Anthony Hamilton that was recently distributed by BMG Music. <br /> <br />On Thursday, SunnComm CEO Peter Jacobs said the company plans legal action and is considering both criminal and civil suits. He said it may charge the student with maligning the company's reputation and, possibly, with violating copyright law that bans the distribution of tools for breaking through digital piracy safeguards. </i> <br /> <br />Suncomm sold a product to damage CDs. Haldemann showed how to get the value back. <br /> <br /><i>'We feel we were the victim of an unannounced agenda and that the company has been wronged,' Jacobs said. 'I think the agenda is: 'Digital property should belong to everyone on the Internet.' I'm not sure that works in the marketplace.' "</i> <br /> <br />The agenda is 'I want to have control of software running on my computer'. Suing for the right to install software on my computer without my permission would (I hope) be thrown out. <br /> <br />Mr Jacobs, it is DRM that doesn't work in the marketplace. Customers don't want to buy damaged CDs that have missing features. <br /> <br />My suggestion to computer manufacturers is as follows. <br /> <br />When the user inserts a 'protected' CD, the computer says: <br />"This CD appears to be damaged - it has a corrupt Table of Contents." <br />"Would you like to burn a corrected copy? [Eject] [Play] [Burn]" <br />

  <a href="http://www.paidcontent.org/stories/ashleyrts.shtml">Ashley Highfield</a>: <br /><i>...future TV will may be unrecognisable from today, defined not just by linear TV channels, packaged and scheduled by television executives, but instead will resemble more of a kaleidoscope, thousands of streams of content, some indistinguishable as actual channels. These streams will mix together broadcasters' content and programmes, and our viewers' contributions. At the simplest level -- audiences will want to organize and re-order content the way they want it. They'll add comments to our programmes,programmes, vote on them and generally mess about with them. But at another level, audiences will want to create these streams of video themselves from scratch, with or without our help. At this end of the spectrum, the traditional 'monologue broadcaster' to 'grateful viewer' relationship will break down, and traditional advertising and subscription models will no longer be viable.</i> <br /> <br />This is so close, but he is still talking about streams. If he can start thinking 'files' not 'streams' he will have the right model maped out. <br /> <br />TiVo's and iPods are hardware devices that customers willingly buy to turn streams into files. If they could get the files directly the whole enterprise is far simpler and more attractive.

  <span class="p-name">Bloggercon live video</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  The conference is over, so I've taken my 'bootleg feed' down. This is the problem with 'live' video - easy to do but no persistence. (Well, OK it wasn't that easy to do - I spent 2 years coding it at Apple so it could be this easy). <br /> <br />Being able to do a live broadcast to the world on a whim with the contents of my backpack, an ethernet cable and a friendly server in Japan is something I would not have predicted when I started working for the BBC in 1988 - especially as I was also using the same computer to share wireless connectivity with half the room, to chat with people on 3 continents, and to write and debug code in the session. <br /> <br />Something I said a few times at Bloggercon is that video and audio are missing the essence of blogging. You can do live video, or you can use your computer to edit together a professional-looking video presentation, but the equivalent of the 'just-in-time' publishing that blogging provide is not there. <br /> <br />I spoke to Jennifer Neal of <a href="http://www.vidiblog.com">VidiBlog</a> about this - their's is a live event service, which isn't VidiBlog, it's VidiChatRoom - it may still be interesting though. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.blognewsnetwork.com/members/0000001/2003/10/05.html#a4556">Adam Curry</a> and I had a chat about trying something more like blogging using the RSS 'enclosures'. I have the beginnings of a tool to automatically move audio posts into iTunes (and hence iPods) as I just can't listen to speech radio at the computer - I need to do it while driving. <br /> <br />There are two aspects we need to solve to make this work. One is on the capture side - making this straightforward. Audblog and similar services do this, but their output is effectively voicemail in the browser, and voicemail suffers from the problem of being easier t make than to listen to. <br />Coming up with a new grammar for presenting video and audio in a 'skimmable' way (as Dan Bricklin put it) is going to be interesting to work out.

Is it the need to appeal to parents with the proposition that it's "educational", which usually results in insincere, uninvolving, hack-design work in children's culture as a whole? Anybody got any ideas?</i> <br /> <br />The problem is twofold. Childrens 'culture' in games or TV is triply disintermediated - by parents, publishers and producers. Most staff actually working in this business are too young to have children, and are ready prey for poorly justified ideology about learning from the second-rate academics they hire as consultants. <br /> <br />I've been there. I helped make forgettable software for small children that did not engage or teach them. <br /> <br />Software in these fields goes through storyboards, linearizing it to the point of dullness; the children often end up with the equivalent of watching a PowerPoint marketing presentation. <br /> <br />The key is, as Liz and Tim imply, is build model worlds for the children to explore and create in, not linearized presentations.

  <span class="p-name">Joe misses the point</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/msft/archives/001551.html">Joe Wilcox</a>: <br /><i>Microsoft claims consumers and businesses can do lots of cool and productive things with Windows. But for all Windows' features, I find what I miss the most is the Internet. Or so I learned a few hours into my three days without Internet access. <br />[...] <br />Until this afternoon, when Comcast kicked local service back on, my computer was uncharacteristically idle, in spite of all the things I should be able to do with a Windows PC. It's the Internet, a creation apart from anything invented by Microsoft, that I missed. E-mail, instant messaging, (legal) downloadable music, online newspapers and wire feeds: These are the things for which I most use my PC and for which I sorely suffered without. <br />[...] <br />The Web has always been about content. Some of the most interesting stuff that could be delivered over the Web, such as movies and music, is not necessarily dependant on Windows for delivery. </i> <br /> <br />He almost saw it, but then dropped the ball in the last paragraph. The Net is about people. The computer is the conduit to the other people through email, music, IM and the web. <br />'Content' is a word for the byproducts of these connections. <br />

  <span class="p-name">How to Atomize (or de-atomize) Syndication</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/09/20/if_i_were_microsoft.html">Joi</a>, <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave</a>, <a href="http://rdf.burningbird.net/archives/001664.htm">Shelley</a> and others have been talking about how Microsoft might approach the Syndication feud. <br /> <br />They're all missing how 'embrace and extend' works. Imagine I'm a developer who wants to write a tool that can read and write to weblogs. I look into it and discover that there are multiple conflicting versions of syndication formats, and multiple inconsistent blog posting APIs. <br />I have to pick which ones to start with, and implement multiple parsers and an outer API to talk to the various blog types available. <br /> <br />If <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage">Atom</a> or Microsoft or <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">RSS 2.0</a> or whomever wants to win converts in the future they need to solve this problem for would-be adopters. Here's how to do it (for clarity, I'm using Atom as the putative protagonist, largely because I can then use the pun 'Atomizer'). <br /> <br />Take <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/postelsLaw">Postel's law</a> seriously. <br /> <br />Implement a web service at atomizer.org that, presented with a feed URI in arbitrary format, returns a usable feed in <a href="http://notabug.com/2002/awiki/syntax">Atom format.</a> (For extra credit, provide an API in mainstream languages that does this transparently when parsing fails). <br /> <br />Implement another web service there that presents the <a href="http://notabug.com/2002/awiki/api">atom API</a> fro arbitrary blog URI's. It bridges the Blogger, Userland, MT, LiveJournal, etc. APis transparently. <br /> <br />Given such services, the choice should become obvious for all future developers. <br /> <br />Will any of these players pull this off? I don't know.

She is a film maker and an attorney and the Executive Director of WITNESS. <br />This is incredibly important work. They are causing a great deal of impact already, but I think blogs could help increase their ability to reach a broader audience. This is such a great reason to figure out video blogging.</i> <br /> <br />He mentions later that he wants to 'deep-link' video. <br /> <br />By this I think he means he wants to excerpt a shorter clip from a longer video and use this as a link. Most web video models don't do this very well; because of inter-frame dependencies in both video and audio, you usually get either a visual glitch or a big bandwidth spike at the beginning of each excerpted clip. A standalone clip may work, a sequence of them will often fail to play right. <br /> <br />In addition, clip selection is fiddly to do well, and all-but impossible for streaming. <br /> <br />I have some ideas on how to get round this issue; it also needs some work on the presentation side for improved effect.

  <span class="p-name">Isenberg takes up Power Laws</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.isen.com/blog/archives/2003_09_01_archive.html#106270242469296826">David Isenberg says</a>: <br /><i>Yahoo and Google are permanently popular; they have low Zipf volatility. But my hypothesis is that there's a middle tier of blogs with high Zipf volatility, where a well expressed idea or a funny story or a new factoid can rapidly catapult a blog from #100,000 to #1000, or in rare cases even to #10, in a matter of hours. <br /> <br />I am not sure how you'd test this idea experimentally (comments appreciated), and I am afraid that if you take 100 blogs, say between #100 and #200, and look at their delta-rank over a one week period, they might not look any different than the blogs between #20,000 and #20,100. Despite this caution, I strongly suspect that blog rank (and web site rank, to a lesser extent) has a burstiness that is not characteristic of other media, that permits new ideas (and new sites and blogs) to bubble up and subside, to move more readily than other media along the x-axis of Zipf's Law.</i> <br /> <br />His intuition is right, but it doesn't just apply to blogs. Consider other power-law distributed things, such as music and movies - their rankings suffer sudden volatility too. <br /> <br />In one sense, the argument is obviously true - with a true power law distribution, once you get down to the smaller numbers there are many with the same value, so a change of one in your value can move you a long way up (or down) the rankings. <br /> <br />However, the underlying catastrophe theory that predicts power laws also predicts cascades of arbritrary size too, so Isenberg's theory is likely to be right.

  <span class="p-name">YesVideo tapping the American experience</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I met with <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs?q=Subutai+Ahmad">Subutai Ahmad</a> of <a href="http://www.yesvideo.com">Yesvideo</a>. <br /> <br />They have taken an interesting approach to the power law distribution of people with video cameras. They taregt the long tail who can't be botherd to edit it themselves. Instead they drop off the videotape at Walgreens with the photos, it gets shipped to Yesvideo, and they digitise it, make a DVD and ship it back. They have smart image processing to pick good chapter points and even make short highlights video. <br /> <br />Watching the multiple screens of people's home movie in the processing plan there I was forcefully reminded of <a href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue6_2/odlyzko/">Andrew Odlyzko's point</a> about how much privately made media there is: <br /> <br /><i>Historically, it appears that privately taken pictures have traditionally been the dominant source of data. An interesting accounting of all the information stored in the world in 1997 by Michael Lesk [Lesk] found that home photographs were the dominant component. (For a more complete and up-to-date accounting of information, see [LymanV]].) They contributed about 500,000 TB each year (even when one assumes that each picture is stored as a modest 10 KB JPEG file). By comparison, all the texts in the Library of Congress amounted to around 20 TB, while the graphics and music in that collection came to about 3,000 TB. Thus even this great library contained less than 1% of the world's information. (The publicly accessible Web pages currently contain a few tens of terabytes, just a few percent of what the Library of Congress has, but comparable to the text collections in that library.) <br /> <br />An obvious comment to the estimates above is that the purpose of a library is to select the most valuable material, and that most of those photographs contributing to the 500,000 TB are of no interest to most people. That is true, but that does not stop those pictures from being taken, and it will not stop an explosion in volumes of data collected this way in the future. A few pictures or video clips will turn out to be of great interest, in spite of amateur production. Just think of the Zapruder film of the JFK assassination, or the Rodney King video. More importantly, many of the pictures being taken are of interest, or might be of potential interest, to at least one person. Most of the world will have no interest in a picture of your newborn baby, but your mother will cherish it. Similarly, in the future you will be taking digital video clips of your children and sending at least some of them to your mother. </i> <br /> <br />Imagine if this company was hooked up to the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>

  <span class="p-name">Media Heresy - DRM destroys value</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  People find the familiar comfortable. They want things to be like they were. So when technology did away with scarcity of recordings by making perfect copying easy, they wanted to change things back, to make these digits behave like physical goods. <br /> <br />This is where the dream of DRM comes from - making digital goods scarce, and enforcing payment. <br /> <br />Now <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.06/view.html?pg=1">using machines to enforce laws is bad</a>. They have no capacity for mercy, latitude or leeway. <br /> <br />And all DRM is readily circumvented as, eventually, it has to turn into patterns of light and sound for people to see and hear, and at this point cameras and microphones can record it. So for the determined adversary, it will be broken. <br /> <br />What this means is that DRM can never thwart the real enemy, it can only annoy the legitimate customers, and they will thus <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_03_01_epeus_archive.html#200021407">Pay less for the product</a>, or not buy it at all. <br /> <br />There is a very odd reward curve here - the paying customers are getting less value than the non-paying circumventers. DRM is all stick and no carrot. <br /> <br />It is for this reason that DRM destroys value, and business models based on DRM always fail. <br /> <br />The putative counter example at the moment is the iTunes Music store, but as <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_05_01_epeus_archive.html#200254407"> Apple ships a circumvention device</a> with the application, by allowing you to burn the songs to CD, the case is unproven to put it mildly. Remember, the $7M that Apple has grossed from the iTMS is small change to them; they make many times that from selling iPods. <br /> <br />If <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1052251547862&call_pageid=968867495754&col=969483191630">the labels succeed in making iTMS Windows stricter</a> it will sell fewer songs. <br /> <br />This week I have been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465016154/epeusepigone-20">Hernando de Soto's <i>The Mystery of Capital</i></a> in which he explains how US property law changed to recognise what was really happening on the ground, rather than what the large landowners wished for. This set off the accumulation of capital that made the US the wealthiest country in the world. <br /> <br />Last week I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316164933/epeusepigone-20"><i>The Perfect Store</i></a> about how Pierre Omidyar created a market for goods online, that was built on mutual trust, and it grew to become eBay, the most profitable of all online businesses. <br /> <br />The time is ripe to do the same for online media, and <a href="http://mediagora.com">create a marketplace that reflects people's desires and trust.</a>

If the aggregators are relatively forgiving, users will trust them, but poorly formed feeds will end up somewhat mangled in different aggregators, leading to less trust in the feeds. Over time, the forgiving aggregators and clean feeds win out. <br />The power of forgiveness has <a href="http://nonzero.blogspot.com/2002_05_01_nonzero_archive.html#85126951"> been demonstrated experimentally</a>.

  <span class="p-name">BBC opens archives</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3177479.stm">Greg Dyke is going to put the BBC archives online</a> <br />15 years ago, I joined the BBC as a video engineer with Television Film Services, an odd department that had dominion over (among other odd sites) Ealing Studios and the film & video archive at Windmill Road. <br />I spent a couple of weeks at Windmill Road, working on the 2-inch Videotape machines which you could edit videotape like film on - a razorblade to cut the tape and splice with sticky tape. You needed to cut at a frame boundary, which you found by looking for the sync pulses on the tape by holding a plastic box full of iron filings over the tape, making the tracks visible. <br />I walked through the archives, seeing rack after rack of old editions of <i>Nationwide</i>, film canisters of a forgotten adaptation of Waugh's Sword of Honour trilogy, and many more fascinating looking can's and tapes. <br />At the time the BBC did not have a rolling re-copying program, and many programs on tape were lost to oxide decay, not recorded at all, or had the tapes re-used. Some missing <a href="http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/archive.htm">Dr Who</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp2/trivia/lost/">Top of the Pops</a> and <a href="http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~r.anderson/dadsarmy/missing.htm">Dad's Army</a>have been recovered, and Rosie's cousin Rob Greenwood spent a great deal of time restoring video for Dr Who and other programs at BBC Enterprises in the 90s, in many cases from 'illicit' off-air recordings by hobbyists. <br /> <br />I hope the BBC can cut through the tangle of copyright restrictions on music in the programs and performance fees for all the old programs; if not the release may be very spotty. <br /> <br />The issue of non-commercial re-use only is also tricky; when purchasing archive footage from the BBC for MMC museum and CD-ROM projects, we often got a tape full of useful material, only to be told that rights on the bits we wanted were unknown or unavailable, and we had to re-edit. <br /> <br />I've heard odd tales about BBC trying to constrain rights geographically before - when they launched the BBC Choice satellite channel, they webcast it for a bit, but tried to only allow UK people to see it, which is a nonsense on the internet. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.oblomovka.com/entries/2003/08/24#1061749500">Danny has more discusion</a>

  <span class="p-name">Bay Area weather - perfect, with earthquakes</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I read <a href="http://reason.com/opeds/vpasap082597.shtml">this article by Virginia Postrel</a> before moving here, nearly 6 years ago now; it seems appropriate today. <br /> <br /><i>Silicon Valley's perfect weather means you don't need backup plans, just in case it rains. It means you don't resent spending a beautiful day inside at work, because tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow will be just as gorgeous. It means you have more energy, sapped neither by sleep-inducing clouds nor enervating heat and humidity. It means fewer days dragging into the office with a brain dulled by allergies and winter colds. It means you have more life. <br /> <br />BUT AGAINST THE BEAUTIFUL blue skies of the valley sprawl its tawny hills, their curves clearly visible beneath a bare wisp of foliage. In the dry landscape of the West, the earth is not camouflaged by trees and vines and underbrush. In the valley, the ground itself is omnipresent. <br /> <br />And, as everyone knows, it is also unstable. <br />[...] <br />Good weather plus earthquakes creates an utterly different environment. On a day-to-day basis, you can concentrate on your goals, with no need for contingency plans. Your softball game, your picnic, your wedding won't be rained out. But everything could change in an instant. You can't anticipate earthquakes, can't plan for them, can't even predict when and where they'll strike. Instead of providing the certainty of seasons, nature promises a future of random shocks. All you can do is develop general coping skills and resources. There is nothing familiar about the aftermath of an earthquake, and no one survives it alone. <br />[...] <br />Once they hit the light, no one can anticipate just where innovations will lead--or whether they will in fact succeed. It is by trusting the search, permitting experiments whose results no one can know, that we allow advances to occur. In a 1979 paper, Wildavsky prefigured his discussion of anticipation and resilience with a meditation on the sources of progress. It depends, he suggested, on spontaneity and serendipity, on discoveries no one can predict or foresee: "Incessant search by many minds...produces more (and more valuable) knowledge than the attempt to program the paths to discovery by a single one....Not only markets rely on spontaneity; science and democracy do as well....Looking back over past performance, adherents of free science, politics, and markets argue that on average their results are better than alternatives, but they cannot say what these will be....The strength of spontaneity, its ability to seek out serendipity, is also its shortcoming--exactly what it will do, as well as precisely how it will do it, cannot be specified in advance." <br /> <br />Nowadays it seems that every place wants to be like Silicon Valley--to discover its secrets and copy them. Here, then, is a secret that can be copied, even in places with lousy weather and stable ground: Don't ask for answers in advance. Don't try to create a life without surprises. Trust serendipity.</i>

The trust I had built up in them meant that I was ready to leave the UK and my successful software publishing management career to become an engineer in the US. <br />I had been hired with the same kind of trust, rather than with any specific job in mind, and so I always had a broader set of contacts than the org chart implied, and we would help one another out. <br /> <br />I carried on as before, talking about my work on mailing lists, and joining ones relevant to the areas I worked in - video editing and streaming media, among others. I had found another group of people with common interests to talk with. Gradually, however, constraints became tighter. <br /> <br />When you are a hardware company, you really need to keep new hardware secret to avoid the Osborne effect - that customers won't buy today because they are waiting for your newer model. Apple's secrecy and PR policies are shaped with this in mind, so when I started arguing in the abstract against DRM, I was warned not to do so using my Apple account, as it might be taken as a corporate position, or foreshadow future products. <br /> <br />I stopped using my Apple email address in public, and began to avoid talking about the technology I worked on - after all there are plenty of other fascinating subjects, and I didn't want to inadvertently reveal something confidential. <br /> <br />Gradually, almost insensibly, my interests changed. While following up on my <a href="http://mediagora.com">mediAgora ideas</a>, I got more and more involved in the details of small world networks and catastrophe theory, and different kinds of social software. <br /> <br />I brought some of these ideas back to work - using a wiki to describe and discuss my ideas for how to improve QuickTime. My manager liked the idea of the wiki, subsuming it into corporate processes to the point where we had meetings to discuss wiki pages, but the ideas were deferred from release to release. My work was ongoing maintenance of the existing code to keep pace with the OS and hardware changes below it, and minor feature requests for the Apps above it. <br /> <br />Now, when compiling on my ageing hardware took too long, or reinstalling the OS every 2 days ate into development time, I spent some downtime on my new interests, as well as helping other Apple employees as before. The work continued, but the passion was gone. <br /> <br />My corporate manager fired me on Friday for not meeting his goals. <br /> <br />Rather than fight it, I am going to take this as a cue to follow a new direction. I'll look to my new 'weak ties' for inspiration. <br /> <br />And I'll still be using hardware and software from Apple and QuickTime - there are a lot of good people still inside.

  <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=16569">Frank Pierson's commencement address to USC Film School</a> is stirring, but has more rhetoric than answers: <br /><i>We have to remind ourselves that this viewer is only another aspect of ourselves, that we have also in us-as he does-a better part, that needs to be cultivated and to express itself. There is no single audience with a single personality. There is the larger audience-currently under-served-that has vast variety of appetites that we can, we must, satisfy. [...] <br /> <br />Our defense is the farmers' market, the yard sale, the auctions. We had hopes for the Internet, but that's being turned into a marketing tool. In the field of entertainment and the arts our last defense may be Tivo and the remote control. <br /> <br />Liberal critics have raised the alarm over corporate censorship, the exclusion from theaters and TV of anything except what seems marketable and the eliminations of anything that might offend somebody anywhere. But the danger of censorship in America is less from business or the religious right or the self righteous left, than to self-censorship by artists themselves, who simply give up. If we can't see a way to get our story told, what is the point of trying? I wonder how many fine, inspiring ideas in every walk of life are strangled in the womb of the imagination because there's no way past the gates of commerce? [...] <br /> <br />You are now our future, and this is the challenge you face. It is a bigger challenge than it seems because you cannot recapture something you never knew. It is your gargantuan task to create this spirit out of thin air, in the face of resistance and lack of interest, in your own style and out of your own imagination. Something new and as yet unknown. </i> <br /> <br /><a href="http://mediagora.com">I'm ready when you are</a>

  <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/08/09/email_experiments_confirm_six_degrees_milgram_didnt.html">Joi </a> points out a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994037">new scientist story</a> about <a href="http://smallworld.columbia.edu">Duncan Watts' experiment</a> that shows 6 degrees of separation, even though Milgram didn't - most of his messages didn't get through. <br /> <br />As well as getting this backwards, the article says: <br /><i>The researchers were surprised to discover that message chains did not rely on a few highly connected individuals, so-called "hubs". Previous research by Watts and fellow Cornell mathematician Steven Strogatz had suggested that such "hubs" were important to all social chains.</i> <br /> <br />This is a common misunderstanding - the hubs are a simplifications, and don't really exist; with enough elements, power law distributions are fairly smooth, and the variety of scales of connectedness is important.

  <span class="p-name">Beware implicit gaussians</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I've discussed <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/powerlaws.html">Power law distributions in the context of music, box office and other charts</a> and the danger of modelling them with gaussians - you over weight the 'top ten' hits, and ignore the 'long tail' of many smaller creators. <br /> <br />The stock market has a complementary problem. Options pricing is done using a model known as Black-Scholes, that has as a key parameter historical volatility, and the variance of price fluctuation is used for this. Now it has long been noticed that Stock market price fluctuations are not distributed as a gaussian - Mandelbrot pointed out they follow a scale-free Power law distribution <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ma1ejm/mandelbrot.html">decades ago.</a>. <br /> <br />However, gaussians are still used all the time in quant analysis. In this case it is the other end of the curve that fails - they see the small fluctuations and model them, but the big disturbances are far more common than is predicted. It is essentially this error that caused the LTCM collapse. The quant's dismiss this effect as acts of god, and unmodellable, but these are exactly the events that destroy your portfolio. <br /> <br /><a href="http://gladwell.com/2002/2002_04_29_a_blowingup.htm">Malcolm Gladwell wrote a profile of Nassim Taleb</a>, one trader who does use power laws rather than gaussians, and does well out of it.

  <span class="p-name">Complementary currencies</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.hos.com">Stephen Hill</a>, on the pho list, points to a great interview with<a href="http://www.nexuspub.com/articles/2003/july2003/interview.htm"> Bernard Lietaer on complementary currencies</a> (ignore the rather schmaltzy new age design; this is deep stuff about monetary theory, clearly explained). <br /><em>First, let's define what a currency is, because most textbooks don't teach what money is. They only explain its functions, that is, what money does. I define money, or currency, as an agreement within a community to use something as a medium of exchange. It's therefore not a thing, it's only an agreement&#8212;like a marriage, like a political party, like a business deal. And most of the time, it's done unconsciously. Nobody's polled about whether you want to use dollars. We're living in this money world like fish in water, taking it completely for granted. <br /> <br />Now the point is: there are many new agreements being made within communities as to the kind of medium of exchange they are willing to accept. As I said, in Britain, you can use frequent flier miles as currency. It's not a universal currency, it's not legal tender, but you can go to the supermarket and buy stuff. And in the United States, it's just a question of time before privately issued currencies will be used to make purchases. Even Alan Greenspan, the governor of the Federal Reserve and the official guardian of the conventional money system, says, "We will see a return of private currencies in the 21st century."</em> <br /> <br />I think Heinlein once wrote that money should be an adjective, not a verb, that we should talk bout the moneyness of things. <br /> <br />Company Stock is in effect private currency, with a fluctuating exchange rate tracked by the Stock Market, and much of the net runs on non-monetary exchange. <br /> <br />Bridging these complementary currencies into the dollar economy is an interesting challenge.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="www.abstractdynamics.org">Abe Burmeister</a>, on the Emergent democracy list, points to an interesting 1996 essay by Manuel DeLanda <br />called <a href="http://www.alamut.com/subj/economics/de_landa/antiMarkets.html">Markets and Antimarkets in the World Economy</a>. <br />It reminds me a bit of my father's 1985 <a href="http://www.ertnet.demon.co.uk/2kinds.html">Two Kinds of Order</a> paper. <br /> <br />Delanda talks of how bottom-up emergent meshwork markets compete with top-down hierarchic anti-markets, discusses historic exmples, and ends on this note: <br /><em>Computers, in the form of embedded intelligence in the buildings that house small firms, can aid this catalytic process, allowing the firm's members to reach some measure of self-organization. Although these efforts are in their infancy, they may one day play a crucial role in adding some heterogeneity to a world-economy that's becoming increasingly homogenized.</em> <br /> <br />As David Weinberger succinctly put it -'Hyperlinks subvert hierarchy'

  <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/22/thoughts_on_microcontent_metadata_and_trends.html">Joi explains his interest in micro-content</a> <br />It's a good summary, but it misses a key point. By emphasising the difference between commercially produced 'content' and user-created 'micro-content' he is ignoring the <a href="http://www.quicktopic.com/19/D/EKxMGmyiii48E.html">enormous area inbetween.</a> <br />The current content publishing model is only efficient for large-runs of sales - sell under a few thousand books, a few hundred thousand CDs, or a few million cinema seats, and you won't be welcome in commercial publishing. <br />This gap is gradually being bridged by innovative companies, such as Cafepress and Customflix, but both of these are still creating physical goods. <br /> <br />I think there is a huge opportunity here to be the eBay of digital media, and I think <a href="http://mediagora.com">mediAgora</a> is the way to go about it.

About a billion a year (Acrobat is funding an entire additional Silicon Valley skyscraper, Adobe's CEO said in a recent magazine article I read). Macromedia makes money off of Flash. Borland makes money off of tools. One of Microsoft's biggest buildings (#42) is full of guys writing tools.</i> <br /> <br />The Palladium/NGSCB information locking is what Scoble is getting at here - he argues that stopping people reading things is the glorious future of profitability for the no-longer-growth-stock MSFT. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/execmail/2003/05-07rightsmanagement.asp">Ballmer</a> explains what is really going on here. <br /><i>A senior partner in an accounting firm needs to send email to his partners with a confidential contract proposal attached. Besides specifying who may read the proposal and that they may not copy, paste or edit the information, he specifies that the email itself cannot be forwarded. The recipients' email and word processing applications transparently enforce these policies. All partners worry less about information leaks that might damage ongoing negotiations.</i> <br /> <br />Ballmer's key mistake here is assuming you can rely on computers when you don't trust people to trust you. <br /> <br />Why are Microsoft so obsessed with this? <br /> <br />I think they still bear the psychological scars from having their internal emails spread all over the papers, and are subconsciously trying to fix this with code... <br /> <br />Personally, I'm all in favour of anyone who thinks this way having their writings made unreadable by others.

  Jem pointed me at <a href="http://www.acmqueue.org/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=43">an interesting article</a> about the future of hard disks. <br /> <br />Nothing very new, (<a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/tv.internet.txt">Odlyzko discussed this trend</a> a few years back) but the implications of disk space growing with a much bigger exponent than CPU, Networking or bus speed are rather subtle. <br /> <br />One interesting one is that audio & video compression become pointless over time, as they clog CPUs, whereas once raw transfer speed catches up, playback can happen without the CPU involved at all.

  <span class="p-name">Social botware</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html">Clay Shirky</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/misc/unspokengroups.html">David Weinberger</a> have been talking about rules for social software. <br />I've been exploring online chat again recently, via iChat and <a href="http://joi.ito.com">Joi's</a> <a href="irc://irc.freednode.net/#joiito">IRC channel</a> <br /> <br />Points Clay and David made both come up - the room occasionally falls into Clay's three default topics, and there has been a bit of kerfuffle about rules, deflected to a <a href="http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/IrcChannel">wiki.</a> <br /> <br />More interesting was the emergence of the room's personality as David describes. This was shaped early on by Jeannie, who joined from AIM, and became an unofficial hostess, damping down the geekiness a bit and making it feel like a place. <br />Victor brought in a bot in Python called 'Jibot', to join Aaron's 'datum' both of which look up information over the net. As Victor's first language is Spanish, he leaned heavily on datum's dictionary and acronym lookups. <br />Jibot being Open Source, various of us modified it to say silly things to each other, but as the frustration with WordNet's dictionary grew, Victor added a way to define and query words in it. <br /> <br />Suddenly, Jeannie started using this to tease and keep track of people, by defining them in the dictionary. I added multiple definitions and the all important 'forget' command, and the bot became a community gossip repository. <br /> <br />Because all the bot commands were issued in public, and people can edit entries, the bot got a wiki-like convergence going, storing persistent info about people. <br /> <br />Last night I added the 'herald' function - now, when people join the room the bot announces them using what has been said about them, or uses a random canned phrase if it doesn't know anything about them yet. <br /> <br />I think this follows both Clays rules for community forming -persistent handles, rewards for core users etc and David's encouragement of informal serendipity. <br /> <br />Seems to work well so far; regulars are introduced, new people want to be, and only a bit of complaining about the bot talking too much

  <span class="p-name">Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I have mainly been engaged in the ongoing copyright debate online, but last week I took part in two different public fora - one was the NPR show <a href="http://discover.npr.org/rundowns/segment.jhtml?wfId=1317007" title="Talk of the Nation page">'Talk of the Nation'</a> which had a <a href="rtsp://audio.npr.org/totn/20030701_totn_04.rm" title="RealPlayer audio">section on music downloading</a> (I'm on at 23:40), the other was the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/ilaw/stanford03/schedule.html">ILAW seminar at Stanford,</a> where they were <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/home?wid=10&func=viewSubmission&sid=38">discussing the same issue.</a> <br />In each case I was both frustrated and concerned. On NPR I explained that the RIAA repreesent only a tiny minority of musicians, and many more are able to take advantage of the net, but was cut off before I could develop the point. <br />At ILAW I was able to make one brief point on emulation, but time ran out before I could explain the objections to the Fisher 'Nationalisation' proposals. <br /> <br />With the Grokster CEO, the Future of Music Coalition and the lawyers at ILAW all wanting the government to fix things for us via compulsory licensing and taxing computers and the net, I am getting concerned. <br /> <br />Lisa Rein did film my off-the-cuff explanations, but I feel I need to do two things - come up with sound bites for use in these occasions in the future, and explain them more fully here. <br /> <br />Here are my sound-bites, which I will call the 6 heresies of digital media: <br /> <br />DRM destroys value <br />The top 20 don't matter <br />Streaming wastes bandwidth <br />Live broadcasts waste time <br />Advertising reduces incentives <br />Compression wastes entropy <br /> <br />I'll expand on these later, as time permits.

  <span class="p-name">Nationalizing music, protection rackets and freedom</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Jim Griffin vehemently objected to my description of his proposals for funding music as 'nationalization'. He is working on an actuarial way to fund copyright payment via a kind of insurance. At present he has not publicly documented his ideas, and he pointed me at <a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/WEBONLY/publicfeature/feb02/copyr.html">this article</a>, which does give a good background, but then advocates these 'solutions': <br />1) A compulsory license on all media for use over computer networks <br />2) A tax on all computer networks and other computing storage devices <br />3) a statistically vague statutory metering model to distribute this money. <br /> <br />Calling this nationalization is not an exaggeration. <br /> <br />Will this compensation scheme pay me for my blog, for my posts to the pho mailing list, for my IM chats and video conferences? <br /> <br />People buy internet connectivity to connect to one another; transferring copyright works is incidental. This is like charging a annual car tax to pay for music listened to on the radio while driving. <br /> <br />Jim's suggested scheme plays into the heart of the democracy debate, because he does not trust the public. He does not believe they will voluntarily pay for music, so they must be coerced. Here's what he said: <br /> <br /><i>payment for music can now truly be said to be voluntary, technically and practically if not legally. [...] <br />A civilized society should not -- I think cannot -- tolerate a voluntary economy in knowledge, creativity, art and speech. [...] <br />I am avowedly for compulsory payments for digital art assessed at the source of the digits, whether internet service provider or digital wireless provider. In the country where you get your digits, you must pay through the service provider, which worldwide is regulated by a sovereign communications agency. </i> <br /> <br />Jim is a good man, and I'm sure if he were given control of disbursing the taxes on computers he would try to do it fairly and well, but I don't believe he'd get the job. I think the kind of regulatory capture we have seen before would take place, and the placemen for the big publishers who feel most threatened by a widening of the market would divert the revenues to themselves. <br /> <br />The iTunes music store and others like them show that people will voluntarily pay, when they perceive a fair deal. <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/jun/23itunes.html">5 million songs sold in 8 weeks</a> to the relatively small pool of users has generated more revenue for Jim's erstwhile clients, the record labels, than 5 years of compulsory licensing from the DMCA. <br /> <br />This is the zeroth law of economics. Uncoerced trades create value, as both parties perceive a benefit, or they don't trade. Coerced trades destroy value. <br /> <br />To increase the funds for art in a sustainable way we need to come up with <a href="http://mediagora.com">models that provide that perceived value.</a> <br /> <br />Jim's 'insurance for copyright payment' is less like nationalization, but it is a lot like a protection racket. Pay off the RIAA and they won't use the Verizon decision to harass you with automated DMCA takedown requests? <br /> <br />It also is predicated on the payment for art falling to the marginal cost of distribution; effectively treating music as homogeneous and of low value; he advocates the great 'lost dream' of the celestial jukebox service. <br /> <br />There has been huge growth, as he concedes, in devices designed to store streams for playback. The million iPods, the success of TiVo devices, and yes, all those CD burners, are concrete counter examples that show how much people value having their own stored media, not relying on a centralized, and possibly ephemeral service. <br /> <br />If the iTunes store's terms were adjusted a bit, to provide a lifetime right to obtain a high-quality unencrypted copy of the work in question, rather than the right to download an encrypted one once, and back it up and burn to CD in your own time, I think it could realise even greater value, as this is what people are trying to buy when they buy CDs. <br /> <br />Jim's (January) post in full, reproduced with permission: <br /> <br /><blockquote>At its essence, I think the current situation can be summed up as follows: Increasingly, we live in a world where payment for music (and other digital art) is voluntary. <br /> <br />Sure, that's always been true to some degree, but the degree is increasing with the erosion of friction. Technology is propelling us to a world of friction-free delivery of music (and books and movies and most speech and art). Indeed, it is fair to say that some are already there -- Qualcomm has a demo vehicle equipped with 2.4mbps wireless (almost two T-1 connections) -- and it is a slippery slope as the rest of us follow. <br /> <br />I repeat, payment for music can now truly be said to be voluntary, technically and practically if not legally. Violations are less enforceable than speeding tickets, with only large-scale violators the avowed targets of authorities. You can find anything you want with a simple software client, and that's not going to change during our lifetimes; in fact, it's going to get easier. Or worse, depending on your perspective. <br /> <br />A civilized society should not -- I think cannot -- tolerate a voluntary economy in knowledge, creativity, art and speech. Quite the opposite, the hallmark of civilization is advancement in the creative arts, and art is indispensable in the advancement of science. <br /> <br />Clearly, some differ on this point. They advocate the straight-line efficiency of free markets on the one hand, but believe morality or technology or the law or some combination will sufficiently compel us to satisfy and stimulate art, knowledge and speech with payment that is essentially by choice. This talk is about speed bumps, or keeping honest people honest, or inducing just enough friction to make a market, or virtual tip jars, suing the supernodes, whatever. Call it what you will, it is the last grasp of an argument that began with control and now pleads for just enough inconvenience or persuasion to keep people buying products or digital keys or authentication services they now know they no longer need to enjoy the art they love. <br /> <br />I do not believe voluntary payment for music will sufficiently spur the growth of the information economy to reward rightsholders in music, movies, books and other digital art, nor do I believe we will develop legal, technical or persuasive means to make payment more than voluntary, unless we enact a sovereign, global system of compulsory payments on digital access, whether wireless or wired. <br /> <br />If you are not part of finding an appropriate solution for compulsory payments then you are part of supporting a world of voluntary payment. Knowingly or not, you must either advocate a solution that collects the money needed to support a global world of audio, video, text and graphics you love, or watch them whither and die. <br /> <br />Supporters of rights management technologies are also unwittingly supporting a world of voluntary payments. These hypothetical, unproven so-called solutions never have and never will achieve their aims for a long list of reasons, but here I will offer only one: Digitization liberates art and knowledge that can be digitized to establish the shortest, most efficient path from source to destination, and this bionomic (www.bionomics.org) notion was designed into the internet and is an inherent feature of digitization. The cat is out of the bag; the shortest path to the music you hear in the dorm room next door will never again include the record store down the street. <br /> <br />As a result, I am avowedly for compulsory payments for digital art assessed at the source of the digits, whether internet service provider or digital wireless provider. In the country where you get your digits, you must pay through the service provider, which worldwide is regulated by a sovereign communications agency. The penetration rates of digital services are now sufficient in almost every country to spread the costs across many wallets such that the payments will not seriously diminish the growth and use of those services. In fact, the opposite is true, because without access to content, whether because of licensing or because its economy continues to dry up for lack of revenue, the services cannot thrive. <br /> <br />Finally, I now believe compulsory payment to be more important than compulsory licensing. I think we cannot live without the former, and the latter will take care of itself with a sufficient pool of money. Like performance rights, you needn't license them, needn't choose a society, but you'd be silly not to do so. Given a sufficient pool of money, there will be plenty of content, and the serious pools created by per connection payments will grow the business by multiples that will bring all major studio content by choice, and offer independents access to global markets previously restricted by practical, legal and illegal obstacles. <br /> <br />We today live in a world of voluntary payment for music, movies and other digital art. Technology's liberation of this content will increasingly outstrip its ability to control the content. We must either fashion and enact a global, sovereign compulsory payment system on digital access or accept an art and knowledge economy based on ever more voluntary payments and the inevitable loss of revenue. And we needn't compel rights holders to join this system; building it will draw them, and while they may not be wrong to await its creation, I believe them certainly wrong if they are not actively a part of bringing it about. </blockquote>

  <span class="p-name">Liebowitz sees decline, blames downloading. I disagree.</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Stan Liebowitz has posted <a href="http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/intprop/main.htm">an updated and revised examination of the impact of MP3 downloads on record sales</a>. <br /> <br /><em>The bottom line: MP3 downloading is harming sales. No other explanations that have been put forward to explain the recent decline hold up under analysis. <br />Nevertheless, how far should we be willing to go to protect the record industry from a 20-25% <br />decline in business? Are recent proposals, such as the Berman bill going too far? My own view is that <br />such proposals are going too far. Should we switch to a non-market alternative as suggested by Lessig, <br />Natenal, and Romer? I believe that switching to a non-market alternative should be an absolutely <br />last-resort policy [...] Allowing record companies to protect their wares using digital right management technology seems to be a far more reasonable alternative.</em> <br /> <br />I've just managed to read this through in detail; it is a thorough piece of work, as before, and measured in its conclusions, but it is still missing a few key measures. <br /> <br />Stan notes that the 'amount of time spent on activities' survey he uses to dismiss displacement of music by DVD or other activities, is methodologically flawed. <br /> <br />The librarying of DVDs rather than albums is not really tested. Seeing per capita DVD sales (and rentals) on the same composite chart showing the different music formats would be very interesting. <br /> <br />The cell-phone/text messaging/chat displacement should not be underestimated either. The amount spent on cellphone connectivity by the text-message generation is enough to displace a fair bit of prerecorded entertainment spending. <br /> <br />These quibbles aside, there is a key methodological problem at the core of the project. It works from the assumption that the RIAA records sold represent the totality of music consumption, and that any online music downloaded necessarily is an infringement of RIAA copyrights. <br /> <br />In fact, there is a great deal of music available online that is from artists outside the RIAA orbit, and freely made available, sometimes to promote CD sales, sometimes just for pleasure. This does reduce RIAA profits, but by displacement, not by theft. <br /> <br />A more subtle point is that network theory predicts that as interconnections between customers grow, the chance of a big cascade hit grows at first, but then as they are exposed to a more diverse range of advice and opinions, it falls off. The hugely increased connectivity that the net and cellphones enable may have caused the phase transition on the customer base. <br /> <br />This is discussed in <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/sfi/publications/Working-Papers/00-12-062.pdf">Duncan Watts' classic paper.</a> <br />In either of these two scenarios, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0411/p13s02-almp.html">the independent labels and musicians do better.</a> <br />

If the copyright owner pays the fee, then the copyright continues. If the owner fails to pay the fee, the work passes into the public domain. Based on historical precedent, we expect 98% of copyrighted works would pass into the public domain after just 50 years. They could keep Mickey for as long as Congress lets them.

  <span class="p-name">Emergent Aristocracy</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  The history of democracies is usually told as a rebellion against an overweening King - George III for America, Louis XVI for France. In England it is King John, in 1215, and the rebellion gave rise to the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/collections/treasures/magna.html">Magna Carta</a> which constrained the powers of a king, and providing for a separate body (of barons) to enforce it. <br /> <br />Cromwell's rebellion against Charles I is not often portrayed as democratic, though the accession of William & Mary in 1688 after James's restoration was notable for the <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/england.htm">English Bill of Rights</a> which further constrained the King's power and in effect made Parliament sovereign. <br /> <br />The history of democracy can be seen as successive (and expanding) answers to the questions: <br />Who gets to vote? <br />Who gets to speak? <br />Who gets to set the topic? <br /> <br />With a single sovereign, or a single parliament, control of the latter two is still tricky; legislative agendas, though longer than historically, are still constrained, and the introduction of legislation is more often reserved to government or elected legislators, and more rarely allowed by referendum. <br /> <br />In a deliberative body, elaborate rules are adopted to ensure only one person speaks at a time. <br /> <br />There is an inherent funneling of debate because of these procedures. <br /> <br />Conversely, online there are millions of conversations happening in parallel, topics are introduced daily, and votes are largely spurious. <br /> <br />The challenge is help these conversations to focus, converge and produce action.

  <a href="http://www.betablog.com/archives/000095.html">Zak</a> picked up on the discussion at Joi's, and Mark commented: <br /> <br /><i>I don't agree with Kevin Marks when he says that conversation is diluted and washed away with wikis. <br />Signal to noise is increased after discussion over a period of time by distilling it to its main points. To get the data to the reader in the best possible way. (sometimes conversations can get heated, and often conversations are over many months.) <br />Wikis often act like Weblogs, example is thread mode, one post after another. But the benefit with wiki is that later some one can refractor the conversation to the important information.</i> <br /> <br />He's missing my point a bit. You can do wiki-like things in blogs, and blog-like things in wikis, but you have to work at it. Blogs don't make subsequent editing easy; Wiki's don't make attribution and temporal order obvious. (Did I just refactor his comment? hmm.) <br /> <br />This reminds me of the cross-blog <a href="http://www.emptybottle.org/glass/2003/04/linguistic_relativism_and_korean.php">Sapir-Whorf discussion</a> going on. <br />Language does not limit thought, but different languages do affect how the thoughts end up being expressed and communicated. Some things are easier to say in one language than another - English doesn't have a (formal) third person imperative, for example, which makes <a href="http://www.seabury.edu/MT/akma/000172.html">translating the Lords Prayer from Greek hard</a>. <br /> <br />It is not inevitable that blogs become personal, wikis become consensual, and mailing lists become confrontational, but that is the tendency of each form, much as <a href="http://www.everypoet.org/pffa/showthread.php?s=&threadid=9930#post64902">Frayn shows the tendency for formal writing to concatenate cliche</a> in a Markovian manner.

  <span class="p-name">Social Software again</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I've posted belated <a href="http://hydra.globalse.org/">Hydra</a> notes from the <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/SSABoF.txt">Social Software Alliance Birds of a Feather</a> and the <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/JournalismBoF.txt">Journalism Birds of a Feather</a> from Emerging Tech last week. Taking notes using Hydra was an intersting experience, with 3 or 4 other people taking them too, correcting my spelling and so on. <br /> <br />The SSA meeting was fairly chaotic - perhaps reflecting the diverse meanings of 'Social'. Clay Shirky did not show up (or if he did, did not speak up); Dave Winer later poured scorn on the efforts, implying it was all about social climbing. <br />Friedrich Hayek <a href="http://www.nzbr.org.nz/documents/speeches/speeches-2003/the_we_word.htm">famously </a> said that the word 'social' empties the noun it is applied to of their meaning. Hayek goes on: <br /><i>� it has in fact become the most harmful instance of what, after Shakespeare's 'I can suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs' ( As You Like It , II, 5), some Americans call a 'weasel word'. As a weasel is alleged to be able to empty an egg without leaving a visible sign, so can these words deprive of content any term to which they are prefixed while seemingly leaving them untouched. A weasel word is used to draw the teeth from a concept one is obliged to employ, but from which one wishes to eliminate all implications that challenge one's ideological premises. </i> <br /> <br />At one point in the meeting, writers of social software were likened to scientists at Los Alamos building the bomb, which is certainly hyperbolic, not to say bollocks. <br /> <br />The subsequent Journalism BoF was less hectic, and more measured. One of the most interesting things for me was the various Blogger/Journalist hybrids like <a href="http://dangillmor.com">Dan, </a> <a href="http://wifinetnews.com/">Glenn,</a> <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/">Scott</a> and <a href="">Doc</a> talking about the difference of voice between a blog and a newspaper, where you would have an editor pushing you into the house style. This reminded me of both <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/article.php3?table=old&section=current&issue=2003-03-22&id=2907">Boris Johnson's NYT experience</a> and the lamented Tish Williams, who left 'Upside' for 'TheStreet.com' in early 2000, and went from a sparkling original voice to yet another tech journalist. (I wanted to link to some of her stellar pieces at upside, but they are all gone - not even google or the wayback machine can find them) <br /> <br />I think this conflict, rather than layout issues is behind the blog/wiki divide that <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/04/29/does_mcluhan_explain_why_some_people_think_wikis_are_beautiful_and_some_people_think_theyre_ugly.html">Joi mentions</a>. <br /> <br />Blogs amplify individual voices. Unlike mailing lists, they don't get lost in the hubbub. Wikis are different - they blur authorship, and drive towards a consensual style. Blogs' temporal flow creates an affordance for conversation that is diluted and washed away in Wikis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

When Linksys and Orinoco cards I purchased didn't work in a Sony laptop, I sent email to five different companies and received 15 to 20 suggestions. Fortunately, the last of these, which trickled in, had the solution (Wireless Zero Configuration was turned off). </em> <br /> <br />This does beg the question 'which part of Zero Configuration didn't they understand?' <br /> <br />If it can be turned off, it's not Zero configuration, is it.

  <span class="p-name">Sapir, Whorf, Pinker, Wonderchicken and Thrash</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  A while back I mentioned Pinker's 'Blank Slate' in response to one of Chris Locke's missives, and Stavros offered to explain the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. He did so today, <a href="http://www.emptybottle.org/glass/003234.php">in great detail,</a> along with fascinating commentary on Korean grammar and society, and how different forms of words are used depending on who one is talking to. I still think Sapir-Whorf is a load of tosh, but this seems to be a consensus now (unless Simon, Dorothea and Akma want to wade in). <br />I would agree is that previously heard or read language shapes subsequent utterances. <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/bookreview.php3?table=old&section=current&issue=2003-04-19&id=1494">Philip Hensher</a> talks of the long linguistic shadow cast by the King James Bible. <br /> <br />Coincidentally, today I was called upon to interpret a conversation between 'John' and 'Thrash', a member of the popular beat combo 'The Orb' for the benefit of the Pho list: <br /> <br />John: <br /><em>hear me now. <br />wot is yous banging on about? <br /></em> <br />Excuse me old chap, I don't quite follow your drift. <br /> <br /><em>judge me wiv me bits not me mula. <br /></em> <br />Consider what I have to say, not my worldly goods. <br /> <br /><em>got speed garage in da house. it's the most bestest, innit? <br /></em> <br />I am listening to an uptempo musical style that was popular 5 years <br />ago, and enjoying it. <br /> <br /><em>i fink i will be going westside to go to me julie. <br />so gimme a shout next time yous is going down to the boozer. <br /></em> <br />I may be visiting the expensive part of London, so let me know if you <br />fancy a potation. <br /> <br />Thrash responds <br /> <br /><em>Big it up! <br /></em> <br />I say! <br /> <br /><em>Ease in the manor respec <br />Look mate check it I is fer real bwoyyy <br /></em> <br />Quieten down - I speak sooth. <br /> <br /><em>Ali g is a pussy bwoy <br /></em> <br />Alistair is fey and effete. <br /> <br /><em>And if the staines massive come darn tooting boy <br />Dey get dare nose bus up <br /></em> <br />If his chums visit my demesnes they'll get a jolly good hiding. <br /> <br /><em>Believe boy I invented the bowl <br />When I was about 15 man <br />Yeah right I used to drive 80 mph the wrong way up charring cross road <br />Old bill giving it large behind <br />We just didn?t give a monkeys flying whatever you know <br /></em> <br />The constabulary never apprehended me for my carefree youthful <br />indiscretions. <br /> <br /><em>Speed garage ?? that for ninny boyz <br />Arvo parte much better innit <br /></em> <br />My musical compositions have more subtlety than up-tempo industrial. <br /> <br /><em>It was behind these bins that me first bang me julie <br />Ahem sorry <br /></em> <br />It does not do to bandy about a ladies name. <br /> <br /><em>As fer wot I is banging about <br />You better read it again innit <br /></em> <br />The subtler shades of meaning in my prose may require further perusal <br />for enlightenment to dawn.

I think the main difference is one of voice. A blog has one person's voice, but a wiki is written by committee, and ends up striving for a consensual tone. <br /> <br />Doc, Steve & I talked about how Rendezvous and RSS need to get together for presence-based blogging.

Yet at every level of the academic institution, a variety of individuals find that the best or easiest way to keep themselves going is by staying out of the way of department life.� At prestigious schools, where people actually have the money to do so, this results in the incessant flying around the world making connections, and the consequent political overvaluation of the so-called global over working in local institutions.� This itself is a form of disengagement.� At the University of Tennessee -- which is nowhere near the "bottom" as these things are assessed -- most faculty members are involved in neither national or local conversations, and as a result become altogether disengaged. <br />[...] I went from being a participant in specific, local, political movements to being� "global," or at least travelling all the time.� Because there weren't enough people in Knoxville who shared my interests.� [...]� Some academics build genuinely useful networks; others simply avoid responsibility for what needs to be done where they are.</em>

  <span class="p-name">Wolfram speaks</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Stephen Wolfram, Author of Mathematica and 'A New Kind of Science' was invited to speak by my employer today. Here are my running notes of his talk: <br />How do structures form? <br />1st assumption - easy to do; didn't work. <br />Approach fundamentally wrong - mathematical analysis worked for simpler phenomena, what can you do differently? <br />Previously based on existing mathematics; wanted a more general construct, which led him to programs. <br />Consider space of all possible programs, and consider what kinds of programs are found in nature. Mathematica is a new tool like telescope or microscope - reveals the computational world. <br /> <br />256 1-d Cellular Automata is a simple program space to explore. (If you're running OS X, try <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/coCA.dmg">my program that draws them</a>) <br /> <br />Patterns in nature look more complex than man-made things. The simple rules can give rise to natural complexity - mollusc shells have very similar patterns. <br /> <br />Without computational tools it is hard to see these patterns; people looked for regularity not irregularities. <br /> <br />Principle of Computational Equivalence - complex systems are of equivalent computation. Not linear - phase transitions between kinds of sophistication. <br />Computational limit is achieved often. <br /> <br />Is rule 30 computationally universal? No, but 110 is. You can make a Turing machine from rule 100 - it is computationally universal. <br /> <br />If the observer is computationally more complex than the system, they can see the patterns; in practice the observer is equivalent in complexity, so systems can look complex. <br /> <br />For a system that is linear or repetitive, you can find out an arbitrary future state; for a computationally complex system you can't. Simulation is necessary, not just convenient. <br /> <br />Mathematics has chosen a subset of possible systems that are tractable, rather than complete. <br /> <br />Simple underlying equations of physics - a 14 bn year program. CA's not appropriate. Do not distinguish matter and space, just define space. Think of space as like water - looks continuous, but is made of interacting particles. Underlying space is a network of nodes with connections between them. Look at dimensionality d dimension r^d nodes. <br /> <br />Are space and time different or not? He thinks yes. Global sync like a CA? Not needed. Consider a single active cell that moves change around. Can only follow the causal network, so you only know others have changed when you get updated too. <br /> <br />Can derive special relativity from the low level network model, and move on to General Relativity. <br /> <br />Not yet derived Quantum Mechanics, but can model particle interactions. <br /> <br />Ongoing reduction of 'specialness' - every time we get less special, science gets more general. Simple abstract systems are as computationally complex as we are. <br /> <br />Process of paradigm shifts - see notes in back of book. <br /> <br />Mathematica - algorithm resource base. Mathematica notebooks as publication model. Symbolic language under Mathematica - symbolic structures. <br /> <br />Schr�dinger's equation relating to these systems - do they apply to PDE's? Yes - start with a Gaussian distribution, get the same kinds of complexity. Can one make PDE's from discrete systems? Yes can do it with fluid mechanics. <br />Can't derive Schr�dinger's equation at the moment. Rigid body mechanics is harder than fluid mechanics. <br /> <br />Bells inequality - atoms can be joined through the 'space' network - only approximately 3-dimensional. <br /> <br />PCE vs awareness & consciousness? Hierarchy - life, intelligence, consciousness. <br />Life definition gets harder as we get machines and programs. Life as we know it has a common ancestor, so there is a historical definition. PCE says there is not a general notion of intelligence or consciousness - they are connected through our 'computational history' through pre-existing evolution. Self-awareness 'Real-time philosophy is hard'. Neural net approach to brain modelling is static - machinery is continuum dynamics. <br /> <br />Penrose's discrete and continuous equations - discrete space 'spin networks' fit with the network model of Wolfram. Penrose thinks computers are different from humans. Penrose's view of computing is that brains are different - he considers computers do predicate logic, and is wrong. Continuum vs discrete mathematics - had thought that continuum could transcend Turing, but can't prove, but can't find examples. <br /> <br />I asked him about the connection between his categories and the applicability of the Central Limit Theorem, and he pointed out that while it would break down for his complex systems, it will also break down for long-tailed distributions too.

  <span class="p-name">Blogs as Kritarchy</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I've been reading a long paper about <a href="http://allserv.rug.ac.be/~frvandun/Texts/Articles/Kritarch1.htm">Kritarchy</a> - governance by justice, and have realised that it describes weblogs rather well. A quote: <br /><i>it is no more than a historical accident that the word �law� came to be used as the translation of �lex�. It was also and more properly used to translate the Latin �ius�, which has nothing to do with the exercise of political authority. �Ius� denotes a bond or obligation arising out of a personal commitment made in solemn speech (�iurare�, to swear) and in a more general sense the order of human affairs that arises out of such mutual commitments. In other words, �ius� presupposes a condition in which people meet as free and equal persons and arrange their affairs by mutual agreements, contracts or covenants. This is in clear contrast to �lex�, which presupposes that one man can unilaterally oblige another.</i> <br /> <br />The notion is of people interacting through mutual consent, conforming to natural law - justice is determined from the Golden rule and its philosophical ramifications. <br />In the physical world, contention over scarce resources undermines this; in the virtual world we can all be judges of each other's thoughts and writings, as there is no coercion for others to read them.

  <span class="p-name">Keep the spectrum, keep it open</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/reading-room/documents/policy-papers/potter-paper.html">Mike Godwin</a> has a suggestion to avoid the Digital TV impasse. Allow each TV station to decide whether to keep the digital spectrum and return the analog, or vice versa, and require them to make their programs available for internet download, <br /> <br />Personally, I don't understand why no-one has pointed out the missing principle in this debate. If TV stations are to be given local monopoly rights over big chunks of public spectrum, they should be required to not encumber their transmissions with encryption or access control, so the public can freely receive their shows.

  A wonderful anti-DRM analogy from 'Sanity' on <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=59637&cid=5665544">Slashdot</a>: <br /><em>Capitalism is a means to manage scarcity, and it is very good at it, but artifically creating scarcity just so that capitalism may be applied is like shooting people to create a demand for hospitals: <br /> <br />"stop shooting people!" <br /> <br /> "what, you don't like hospitals?"</em> <br />

  <span class="p-name">Googlewash? Hogwash.</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Andrew Orlowski has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30087.html">written a rant about bloggers 'googlewashing'</a> the phrase 'second superpower'. <br /> <br />Separating out the bizarre attacks on <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi Ito</a> for eating lunch, his thesis seems to be that 'A-list bloggers' have hijacked and neutered the phrase from the Anti-war (or anti-Bush) protesters, and swamped Google with this new interpretation. <br /> <br />In fact, the original article he cites (reproduced <a href="http://quicksitebuilder.cnet.com/supfacts/id130.html">here</a>) did not contain the phrase 'second superpower'; it had a throwaway rhetorical flourish in the first sentence: <br /><em>The fracturing of the Western alliance over Iraq and the huge antiwar demonstrations around the world this weekend are reminders that there may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion.</em> <br /> <br />(Orlowski elides the first part about the Western alliance to support his thesis that it's all about the street, man). <br /> <br />As he says, this meme circulated about the web a bit, and eventually<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jmoore/secondsuperpower.html"> James Moore explored the idea in more detail</a>, and a broader context than just marching against Bush, combining it with the preceding discussions on 'emergent democracy' that had been going for a while. Of course this gets a higher rank for 'second superpower' - it is in the title, and enough people found it interesting enough to link to. (Update: today the NYT removed its archives from the web, so any links to the original article would now be dead). <br />Instead of a lot of incoherent slogans, here are people discussing how to bring it about. <br />Orlowski then completely distorts the quote from <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/electrolite/archives/002479.html">Patrick Nielsen Hayden</a> I posted to the list. Discussing a report on the very disruptive, street-blocking protests, where protesters in San Francisco, Boston, Washington and elsewhere shouted the same slogan, "This is what democracy looks like!" <br /> <br />Patrick said <br /><em>No, that's not what democracy looks like. <br /> <br />It's what protest looks like, and it's often the right thing to do. And of course "democracy" had better entail significant tolerance of unruly protest, or it's not very democratic. <br /> <br />But that slogan is stupid, even by the standards of slogans. Long and often boring meetings are what democracy looks like. Tiresome horse-trading is what democracy looks like. Talking to your neighbors is what democracy looks like. <br /> <br />Democracy can function perfectly well without people painting their faces and blocking streets. It can't function at all without that other stuff.</em> <br /> <br />The emergent democracy group is about how to build tools and structures to capture democratic intent in a digital world. If you're interested in this, join in. <br /> <br />Perhaps what Orlowski is really worried about is that a group who aren't part of the clerisy of professional Journalists and activists are taking an interest, and actually discussing ideas calmly and rationally, and thereby attracting links from other people, <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc</a> and <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave</a> earned their high Google rankings by writing lots of things that people found interesting enough to link to, day after day for many years. <br /> <br />Andrew, if you have interesting things to say about the future of democracy, join the discussion, but don't troll for cheap links by stooping to selective quotation and ad hominem attacks. <br /> <br />Coda: <br />I like to link to Orwell's <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English Language</a> essay at least once a year, if only to remind myself to re-read it. Mr Orlowski could profit from reviewing it too. His neologism 'googlewash' falls down on Orwell's criterion of creating a meaningful metaphor. Orlowski derives it from 'greenwash' which evidently derives from 'whitewash' - to paint over flaws to give a gleaming exterior. Yet 'googlewash' does not follow here - the complaint is not that the new google-friendly definition is hiding the flaws of the old, is it? <br />As Orwell puts it: <br /><em>The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not.</em>

  I don't plan to add to the mountain of verbiage flooding online about the Iraq war, but I find myself turning to media from England as well as weblogs, and thought I'd pass some links on. <br /> <br /><table><tr><td><img src="http://www.bbctraining.co.uk/worldServiceTraining/images/bushhouse_grn.jpg" /></td><td>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/index.shtml">BBC World Service</a> has ongoing coverage that is clear with the headlines on the hour and has lots of interesting backstory inbetween. They try to stay impartial, despite being based in <strong>Bush</strong> House (which does have 'Nation shall speak Peace unto Nation' engraved on the facade). BBC Radio Five Live is quite good too. Shame the streams keep dropping out. <br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2870361.stm">This page</a> is close to being an aggregator of journalists blogs, except they change the URL every day</td></tr></table> <br /> <br />Last week's <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/frontpage.php3?table=old&section=back&issue=2003-03-15">Spectator</a> has some good opinion pieces on the war and background. <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/article.php3?table=old&section=back&issue=2003-03-15&id=2884">Roger Scruton</a> made a point in his essay about the Anglosphere vs EU/UN split that meshes well with the '<a href="http://topicexchange.com/t/emergent_democracy/">emergent democracy</a>' ideas (he earlier talked about <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/article.php3?table=old&section=current&issue=2003-03-22&id=1866&searchText=">avoiding the tyranny of the majority</a>) : <br /><em>England gave us other good things besides the richest language and most powerful literature in modern Europe. In particular it gave us the common law. Our law is not a collection of decrees dictated by the sovereign but a developing set of answers to concrete human conflicts, discovered by impartial judges in the courts. It embodies the old idea of natural justice, according to which law stands in judgment over the sovereign and does not merely transmit his decrees. The common law is the true origin of our freedoms, of our safety in the face of state power, and of our ability to lead our own lives, however eccentric, without asking anyone&#8217;s permission. The EU has been built upon a conception of legal order that takes the decree (or &#8216;directive&#8217;) rather than the particular case and its ratio decidendi, as its paradigm. This, in my view, is the real reason why the English rebel against it &#8212; even those who have no knowledge of the history and the inherited conception of justice that make this rebellion inevitable, obligatory and right. [...] <br />Our Bill of Rights was taken up and re-affirmed in the first Ten Amendments to the American Constitution. This fundamentally backward-looking document did not destroy the common-law jurisdiction, but upheld it, both endorsing its principles and ensuring that the courts remain the final source of law &#8212; which is why the American Constitution can now be understood only through 400 or so volumes of case law. In this and many other respects the US Constitution is heir to the Anglo-Saxon experience of law, as the voice of the people against the sovereign, and the defender of individual freedom against the state. This experience separates both us and the Americans from the history of Continental Europe since the Reformation. </em> <br /> <br />The <a href="http://www.opinion.telegraph.co.uk">Telegraph's Opinion Page</a> has a good mix of views, from <a href="http://www.opinion.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fopinion%2F2003%2F03%2F21%2Fdo2104.xml">Peter Simple</a>: <br /><em>Now Tony Blair has his way and his war. It is, he says, a war against chaos, for which the whole world must unite. So the "war against terror" makes way for the "war against chaos", another war against an abstract noun and as nonsensical as the "war against racism" or the "war against poverty". <br /> <br />Chaos is within us. Will the war against Iraq be the beginning of a process in which the whole world will descend into chaos, no piece of politician's rhetoric but terrible reality, a state from which it may never emerge?</em> <br />to Armando Ianucci's lament for the 'Stop the War' protests: <br /><em>the anti-war movement collapsed into the usual non-media-friendly succession of images we often associate with lost causes; threadbare lines of wackily dressed people holding candles, celebrities with masking tape over their mouths, "resting" actresses saying it's all appalling. <br /> <br />Not good. Stop the War was just not savvy, not cynical enough, to steal Blair's 1997 clothes, and make each and every one of its spokesmen look respectable, look the part, on message and on focus, appealing to Middle England.</em> <br />to <a href="http://www.opinion.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/03/21/do2101.xml">Adel Darwish on Saddam's favourite movie</a>: <br /><em>Saddam's favourite film, he told us that afternoon, was The Godfather - and he seemed, as president, to become the personification of Al Pacino's murderous gangster Michael Corleone. <br /> <br />In that film, the shooting of the Godfather throws New York's underworld into anarchy, confusion and bloodshed. George W Bush and Tony Blair might do well to heed the parallel. The disappearance of Saddam from the scene could throw the region into just such confusion, and they may be in no doubt that Saddam will make every effort to maximise that effect.</em> <br />Even the Grauniad has a couple of good articles- <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,918686,00.html">one</a> on TV's hunger for 'shock and awe', combined with its determination to keep showing news even when nothing is new, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4630027,00.html">another</a> on the way Cruise missiles changed war. <br /> <br />The Economist explains <a href="http://economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1648616">why people believe complex conspiracy theories</a> <br /> <br />So why does London have richer opinion pages than New York ? <br /><a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/article.php3?table=old&section=current&issue=2003-03-22&id=2907">Boris Johnson suggests one reason.</a>

  <span class="p-name">Vote Links</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  After much discussion with the <a href="http://mail.greaterdemocracy.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi/1/">emergent democracy gang</a>, here is my proposal for Vote Links. <br /> <br />I propose that we add an optional attribute to the &lt;a&gt; (link) tag in HTML. Its name is 'vote'. Its value can be "+" "0" or "-", representing agreement, abstention or indifference, and disagreement respectively. <br /> <br />An untagged link is deemed to have value "+". <br /> <br />Additional human-readable commentary can be added using the existing 'title' attribute, which most browsers show as a rollover. <br /> <br />Examples: <br /><pre>&lt;a href="http://ragingcow.blogspot.com" vote="+" title="neat spoof"&gt;Raging Cow&lt;/a&gt;</pre> yields <br /><a href="http://ragingcow.blogspot.com" vote="+" title="neat spoof">Raging Cow</a> <br /><pre>&lt;a href="http://ragingcow.com" vote="-" title="nasty corn syrup drink"&gt;Raging Cow&lt;/a&gt;</pre> yields <br /><a href="http://ragingcow.com" vote="-" title="nasty corn syrup drink">Raging Cow</a> <br /> <br />Points that keep coming up: <br /><i>Why only + and -? How about something more nuanced?</i> <br />The point of this is to provide a strong yes/no response. Finer-grained measures of agreement don't make much sense on an individual basis; aggregating many votes is more interesting. For example, consider how eBay's user rating system has been reduced to a like/dislike switch by users. The 'Ayes, Noes, abstentions' model has served well in politics. <br /><i>There are much richer ways to express this idea and similar ones using RDF and semantic web ideas</i> <br />Indeed there are, but typing them by hand and remembering them is beyond most mere mortals, and automated tools don't do this either. This is meant to be very simple, memorable and easy to type in the current generation of blogging tools, that largely need manual entry of URLs. <br /><i>I'd like some visual representation on the page of these different types</i> <br />You can do that by defining 'voteyes' 'voteno' and 'abstain' classes in css and applying them to the post as well. <br /><i>Won't all this negativity lead to trolling and flame wars?</i> <br />Trolling is a problem already - Google's PageRank rewards being linked to, so notoreity is valued as highly as popularity. This leads to a 'no publicity is bad publicity' approach. <br />For relentless positivists, the '0' and '-' values could be taken as signals meaning "don't index this link". For Vote tallying, however, positive and negative responses are both valuable and clear. <br />The possibility of a personally filtered search, which reflects your own values expressed by your own links is gretaly enhanced by the ability to define neagative links as well. <br /> <br />More discussion: <br /><a href="http://www.workpractice.com/trigg/thesis-chap4.html">Exhaustive taxonomy of link types</a> Far too much complexity. <br /><a href="http://www.ashbykuhlman.net/blog/2002/09/06/0546">An earlier call for this kind of thing</a> <br /><a href="http://www.weblogsky.com/2003_03_01_blarchive.html#90658884">John Lebovsky's variation on a theme</a> <br /><a href="http://www.discover.com/apr_03/feattech.html">Steven Johnson channels Vonnegut on Karasses & Granfalloons</a>

Odd to go into a room and not recognise anyone, then realise that you actually do know several of them... <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/">Tim Oren</a> and I took on <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/">Marc Canter</a> on his 'video is special, and needs special treatment by routers' argument. I must write up this stuff soon, as it needs explaining. <br /><a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris</a> and <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/images/google/photos/photo_3.html">Gretchen</a> produced some bottles of <a href="http://ragingcow.blogspot.com">Raging Cow</a>. I can confirm that it tastes like off milk with high fructose corn syrup added, but as someone passing said, if you're drinking corn syrup, make sure it is high fructose. <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/images/google/photos/photo_52.html">Raj found some silly hats</a>. <br /><a href="http://remarque.org/~xcohen/">Alex Cohen</a> introduced me to <a href="http://www.simonperry.org/">Simon Perry</a>, who was very taken with the <a href="http://mediagora.com">mediAgora</a> ideas. <br /> <br /><a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com">Denise</a> told me about the FareChase case, which could set a precedent making Google illegal - effectively, American Airlines has a court ruling that gives them control over which browsers can display their webpages, and whether further information can be derived from them. She also got me chatting to <a href="http://www.rageboy.com/blogger.html">Chris Locke,</a> using her very borg-like bluetooth phone earpiece. <br /> <br />I talked to various Blogger and Google people about ideas. Simple ones first: <br /> <br />Add a permalink link to each post in the lower pane of the Blogger editor. that way when I write a post, or find an old one there, I don't need to open the blog and find it again to mail the link to someone, or refer to it in another post. <br /> <br />Make damn sure the new Blogger supports a usable RPC posting API so that people can write non-browser based editors well. NetNewsWirePro is great, but it gets lots of errors back from the Blogger server, and it can't post Titles. It works much better with MT, <br /> <br />I also talked a lot about the 'voting links' proposal, and have been inundated by emails about it today. I'll blog a straw man proposal in the next entry. What I learned from Google people was that Google looks in the text of pages for signifiers to use as evidence, then analyses their actual utility in discriminating good links from bad, so think of it as automated utilitarian hermeneutics. <br /> <br />

  <span class="p-name">Anti-links - linking to things you disagree with and saying so</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Two thoughts came together today. In the <a href="http://topicexchange.com/t/emergent_democracy/">emergent democracy</a> discussions, there have been suggestions for easy internet polling, with the ability to accumulate poll results between sites via links. Thus on your website you could advocate or oppose a poll that someone else has initiated, and distinguish votes cast from your page from overall votes. <br /> <br />This made me think about the <a href="http://ragingcow.blogspot.com">Raging Cow</a> controversy, where milk drink marketers exploited bloggers' tendency to rabidly discuss anything weblog related, and link to their website, driving the drink Google's rankings. <br /> <br />Combining these ideas, how about some extensions to the 'a href' tag to say "I'm linking to this, but I disagree with it" and maybe "I'm linking to this but don't count the link as a vote". Google and other link spiders could note these distinctions, and distinguish between popularity, notoriety and ubiquity. <br /> <br />There is also a lot more scope for deriving a personalised search this way - excluding what Cory calls 'left-handed whuffie' and returning search results from places you are likely to agree or disagree with, as well as showing more nuanced rankings. <br /> <br />This is a higher-level way to not feed the trolls.

  <span class="p-name">Morton's Fork of DRM</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/cmusings/2003/03/12#a69">Derek Slater</a> is pondering DRM again: <br /> <br /><em>I feel like there's a huge divide between people who think that DRM has no chance because consumers will always be able to get digital media for free, and the people who think DRM has no chance but consumers will still pay.<P dir=ltr>Within that first category, there's another subdivision: people who think that means we need DRM that's far more difficult to crack (TCPA, Palladium, etc.), and people who think we need a more radical solution (Professor Fisher's plan, for instance).</P><P dir=ltr>I don't know which side is right. But, I think a lot has to do with how good DRM can be and, perhaps more importantly, how good do we need it to be. If all DRM is crackable or can be gotten around via the analog hole, how many people do we need to still purchase things legally to remunerate creators? </P><P dir=ltr>(You can also take the position of <A href="http://www.mediAgora.com">Kevin Marks</A>, who says that DRM no matter how good is doomed to fail, because it "destroys value." I'm not so sure of that, inasmuch as, if reasonable restrictions could be built into DRM, then perhaps consumers would accept it. I also don't know if such reasonable DRM could exist.)</P></em> <br /> <br />That's my Morton's Fork of DRM. <br />It is always going to be crackable by emulation, via the Church-Turing thesis, or by analog means, so a determined person will break it. <br />The only reason for applying it is to make files less convenient to customers, so it automatically makes them less valuable to them. <br />The BALANCE act should go a long way to making DRM 'reasonable', but as that point approaches, it is even more reasonable to avoid the entanglement altogether.

  <span class="p-name">Mediated personae redux</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/archive/2003_03_11_archive.asp#90539334">William Gibson</a> restates David Weinberger's observation that we are <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_01_01_archive.html#8939753">writing ourselves into existence</a> on the web: <br /><em>A mediated persona just sort of accumulates, of its own accord, the way balls of dust build up under a bed. It isn't as though there's any entity ("the media") controlling this process; it just happens. If there was something, no matter what, that you didn't do, and you kept meeting strangers who were convinced you did do that, because they had received, from the dust-ball of your mediated persona, the idea that you did, it might eventually start to bug you too. [...] <br />While I'm on the topic of mediated personae, something that came up during that CBC taping, last night (for me, anyway) was the idea that blogging (or even posting to fora) represents the democratization of the mediated persona. Literally anyone can have one, now, or several. I am an exception to this, because I have mine via the printed word, the oldest mass medium on the planet, and this website is maintained by a publishing company that belongs to an even larger corporation owned in turn by shapeshifting reptiles from Beta Reticuli, but the rest of you, today, are free to mass-mediate your own personae. Which was formerly, hugely, not the case. Choose a handle, post: you're mediating a persona. </em>

  <span class="p-name">Commons Sense</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000308.html">Ed Felten wonders why the net hasn't suffered a Tragedy of the Commons. </a> <br />The key reason is the deep one that people are smarter than economists think they are, and find solutions that resolve such tragedies. <br /> <br />In the case of TCP, it is actually a very good solution to utilising available bandwidth to maximum efficiency. If you ignore the back-off requirement, you're going to get more dropped packets, and thus need more retransmissions. At an endpoint there is no way to distinguish a packet drop due to congestion from a packet drop due to a bottleneck link, so being able to push other traffic out of the way may not be possible. Also, you need co-operation from both ends to do this, which puts constraints on widespread adoption. <br /> <br />Looked at another way, there are attempts to ignore this constraint. In the extreme they are called Distributed Denial of Service attacks, where packet floods knock out servers. Pretty quickly the commoners identify such activity and find a way to block it. <br /> <br />Another attempt is real-time streaming protocols, that just send out UDP packets at a source-dependent rate and assume some will be lost. They are inherently inefficient, as they don't accommodate bandwidth variation the way TCP does. Over time, these protocols have gradually changed to add retransmission and packet thinning so they converge on TCP. In practice, far more media is sent over TCP than is sent using real-time protocols. <br /> <br />Populations can tolerate a small proportion of free-riders like the streamers, but they end up being self-limiting, as the received quality is not usable with too much packet loss.

[...] <br />Kay McCarthy, the hotel's telecommunications manager, explained that the system, once it is fully operational, would allow guests to buy a "scratch card" <br />with coding enabling them to log on for hourly increments. Wi-Fi zones are indiscriminate - anyone in the immediate vicinity of the hotel will be able to log onto the One Aldwych home screen and its promotional links. But only those who buy the access card will be able to continue onto the Internet itself.</em> <br /> <br />Scratch cards? How tacky. I trust that the Savoy and Claridges will have a bit more class than that. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, in Blogaria... <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.lileks.com/bleats/archive/03/0303/030303.html">James Lileks at the Mall:</a> <br /><em>I promise a lot of things here, but eventually I deliver. There will be T-shirts, some day. There will be video-blogs, soon. I�m going to add a weekly streaming video here, but since I don�t have broadband at home the notion of uploading huge files via my syrup-through-a-pipette connection was daunting. Then I remembered that the Apple Store has a wireless network. So. That night I roughed up a prototype of a weekly movie, and Sunday I went back to the store. <br /> <br />It�s simple: you open the laptop, and your machine hears the music of the spheres. Right there in my menubar was the name of the network. I connected, called up my iDisk - a virtual hard drive that exists GOD knows where on some computer somewhere in the world; could be next door or half a continent away. Doesn�t really matter. I transferred the movie to the iDisk over the wireless network, and then as long as I was there I let the laptop gulp up all the software updates it requested. <br /> <br />Apple!

But soon it will be ubiquitous. <br /> <br /> As I wrote over a year ago, businesses already seem to be rearranging things to suit personal technology by creating more comfortable places to sit, chat on cellphones, check e-mail, and so on. <br /> <br />Wireless Internet access is cheap and easy to provide (I have it at home, and so do countless other Americans), and as people get more and more used to it, spaces that don�t have it seem less and less appealing.

This fits in neatly with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670031518/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">The Blank Slate</a> again - Pinker cites variations on the Ultimatum experiment that show that some degree of traceability encourages fairness - this is similar to the work showing that in an interated Prisoners Dilemma the future casts a shadow that encourages co-operation rather than cheating. <br /> <br />So how do I apply this to mediAgora? There is some need for identity there, as if a perpetual right to a good quality copy is being bought, the seller needs to be able to identify the customer again. Simialrly, if the customer wants to become a Promoter their identity is necessary to ensure they get paid. I think this works as a quid pro quo for the benefits received. There is certainly scope for buyer and seller rating too.

  <span class="p-name">DRM versus Democracy</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I would have liked to have been at the <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/institutes/bclt/drm/ ">Berkeley DRM conference</a> yesterday, but I have a good sense of what went on from <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000821.shtml#0008">Dan</a>, <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000849">Aaron</a>, <a href="http://mindjack.com/relay/relay/index.shtml?2003_02_01_index.shtml#%0A90390907">Bryan</a>, and <a href="http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/biplog/">Mary</a>. <br /> <br />Two things strike me. <br />One is that no-one seems to be making the 'DRM Destroys Value' argument. It is demonstrable fact that customers will pay far less for locked up media than open media, so moving to locked media hurts your bottom line directly, far more than the 'leakage' of copying. <br />When combined with the fact that DRM is readily circumvented by the determined, but an annoyance to the purchaser, you have avery odd reward curve at work - the paying customers are getting less value than the non-paying circumventers. DRM is all stick and no carrot. <br />Instead, <a href="http://mediagora.com">mediAgora</a> proposes an incentive scheme for those who encourage sales of what customers really want - rights in perpetuity to unencrypted, high quality files. <br /> <br />The second point fits more into the <a href="http://joi.ito.com/static/emergentdemocracy.html">'Emergent Democracy'</a> slot. The current ways of recording these thing via individual note-taking on weblogs are handy, but I feel that more could be done. I spent a lot of time in the early 90s working on ways of capturing multimedia versions of conference presentations, and these days an audio or even video recording is trivial to make. <br /> <br />The problem is that, like Audioblogging, it is not really much use - to have to listen through many hours of presentations in real time, rather than read summaries by others is less good to me. I had the same frustration with the emerging democracy phone conferences, as I wasn't there in real time, and had snippets of transcripts to go on. <br /> <br />What is missing is a just-in-time production tool that lets many people annotate and segment the ongoing recording, as they are listening, or afterwards. Commenting in a public space, like a shared weblog, with sound and slides neatly annotated and highlighted by many hands. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/onenote/">OneNote</a> is groping towards this, but is is focused instead on generating private Office documents, instead of a public discourse. This is of a piece with the <a href="#90357572">'Office DRM'</a> announced earlier this week. Microsoft has taken exactly the wrong message from having its damning internal memos revealed in court. Instead of behaving in a manner that can stand up up too public scrutiny, and encouraging public debate, it has invested in a plan to help hide corporate discussions though technology. <br />The best way to lose a battle of ideas is for no-one to be able to hear yours.

  <span class="p-name">Utopias and Tragedies</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670031518/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">the Blank Slate by Steven Pinker</a>, and have just got to the section on Politics. Pinker distinguishes between the Utopian Vision, which assumes man is perfectible on earth, if his environment can be improved, and the Tragic Vision, which assumes that Human Nature is complex, and you need to arrange society with this in mind. <br /> <br />This reminds me of <a href="http://nonzero.blogspot.com/2002_03_01_nonzero_archive.html#75021974">a discussion</a> David W and I had last year on the non-zero blog, where I said 'there are those who see in the seedier side of the web the darkness of their own souls, for we are all fallen creatures, and the line between good and evil runs through all our hearts.' <br /> <br />I see from <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_1_oh_to_be.html">Theodore Dalrymple's essay on Macbeth,</a> which expresses the Tragic Vision clearly, that I was unconsciously quoting Solzhenitsyn, before I quoted Nietzsche & Wilde too. <br /> <br />If we are to construct new public selves online, and move to an <a href="http://joi.ito.com/static/emergentdemocracy.html">Emergent Democracy,</a> we need to keep both these visions in mind, and ensure that the frameworks we work within are suffused with the checks and balances that the Tragic Visionaries brought to the design of the US Constitution, tempering the Utopian view. <br />

  <span class="p-name">A real Universal Turing machine</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/backissues/joho-feb25-03.html#UAC">David Weinberger</a> is worried about the 'Universe as Computer ' idea, and confused by some metaphors, and wishes we'd stick to something comfortably obscure, like quantum mechanics. <br /> <br />David, I think what Kelly is getting at is quantum mechanics- Hydrogen bonds with Oxygen by finding the minimum energy state, thus solving a complex wavefunction equation with a single quantum resolution (join or not join). In effect all the probabilities are evaluated at once in the quantum superposition. Not sure what that has to do with Wolfram's thesis though. <br /> <br />Universe as Computer does explain determinism differently. Wolfram shows that complexity can emerge from very simple rules, in Cellular automata and many other interacting systems. However, although deterministic, they are not predictable. The only way to find out what comes next is to run the program. <br />He proposes a theory of computational equivalence, based on the Church-Turing thesis that any sufficiently advanced computer can simulate any other. He shows that he can make a Turing-complete computer from his simple cellular automaton with the emergent complexity, and thus it could perform any computation. Running a program will take the same amount of time (to within an order approximation - eg Order(n) Order (n<sup>2</sup>), or whatever). <br /> <br />Thus although the world is deterministic, following known physical laws, you can't find an analytic solution that gives the answer - there are no short cuts. <br /> <br />You just have to live it and see what happens next. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

  <div class="e-content">
  
  Microsoft has decided that Office's ability to <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1001-985496.html?tag=lh">make documents unreadable</a> unless you're running the same version is a feature, not a bug, and now require you to conenct to a server as well. <br /> <br /><em>A user's computer must be able to access the Windows Server 2003 running RMS on first opening a document to authenticate the rights and decrypt the document. Otherwise, the document cannot be opened. In the future, Microsoft plans to offer an "offline" rights authentication mechanism, but not with this version of RMS. <br /> <br />Other issues affecting the portability of rights associated with documents could cause other problems. Nash claimed that RMS is "platform agnostic"--meaning it will work with any operating system--in that "Windows Rights Management supports industry standards." But for people to be able to access RMS-protected documents on, say, Mac OS X or Linux, the operating systems must use XrML (Extensible Rights Markup Language) in the same way Microsoft does. In that case, "there is the opportunity for interoperability of document interchange," Nash said. Otherwise, the document could not be opened on the non-Windows operating system. <br /> <br />The same restriction in one sense applies to other Windows users. "If you shared the document with another Windows user and that Windows user hadn't installed (RMS), that other Windows user couldn't open the document as well," Nash said.</em> <br /> <br />This is exactly what <a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=938">James Grimmelman</a> explains in detail won't work, and why.

  <span class="p-name">Google's unique insight into Blogging</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  The growth of weblogs has been a classic disruptive technology event, with adoption and traffic driven by individuals rather than corporations. Google has had a leading edge insight into this because of the objectivity of the PageRank algorithm in measuring the connectedness of the web. Weblogs are a powerful driver of the emergent ordering of websites that Google tracks - I was able to get <a href="http://funnystories.blogspot.com/">my son's website</a> to be the top result for both <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=andrew+marks">'andrew marks'</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=funniest+stories">'funniest stories'</a> on Google by mentioning it on my weblog and having it picked up by other webloggers who found it amusing. <br />The Weblogs and power laws paper I wrote makes clear how important the long tail of webloggers is to the number of links online - they have a census view of links at Google, and can see how big and important the tail really is, even though their business is showing others only the head. <br /> <br />Most other web traffic measurement sites are following pageviews, and not considering power law distributions, so they will show the high end bias I discussed in the power law paper.

We built a ranking system to deal with annotations. We wanted to annotate the web--build a system so that after you'd viewed a page you could click and see what smart comments other people had about it. But how do you decide who gets to annotate Yahoo? We needed to figure out how to choose which annotations people should look at, which meant that we needed to figure out which other sites contained comments we should classify as authoritative. Hence PageRank. <br /> <br />"Only later did we realize that PageRank was much more useful for search than for annotation..."</em>

  <span class="p-name">Woodstock win todays award for cluelessness</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  This isn't really worth the time to pick it to bits, but just in case anyone is tempted... <br /> <br /><a href="http://woodstocksystems.com/about_file_lending.html">Woodstock�s Approach to Digital Audio File Borrowing and Lending <br /></a> <br /><em>Patent-Pending Technology that Replicates Physical World <br /> <br />Woodstock Systems has developed a set of patent pending technologies to replicate the physical world digitally, across the Internet. The technologies allow one friend to authorize another friend to borrow music from their PC. When one borrows a music track, it is streamed, in real time, to their PC from the lending machine. During the lending process, a full copy of the digital audio file is never created; either on the borrowing device or the lending device. Only small temporary chunks are streamed as needed. The chunks are never fully assembled on the destination device.The chunks only reside in the RAM of the computers. They never are stored on the Hard Drive or in any form of semi-permanent or permanent cache. <br />All chunks are encrypted during the process, making it impossible to make an exact digital copy even if the chunks could be captured and reassembled at the borrowing device. <br /></em> <br />1) Hook up an audio cable. Press record. <br /> <br />2) Capture the audio at the driver level, and spool to a file <br /> <br /><em>While you have the track borrowed, the lending machine designates the entire album on which the track belongs to as �borrowed�. The borrowed album is then virtually in possession of the borrower. All devices except the one borrowing device are restricted from rendering (playing) any track from this album. Even the owner�s PC where the full file resides cannot listen to the track while it is borrowed. This provides all the same controls and restrictions as in the real world when someone physically borrows a CD. <br /></em> <br />Why on earth would anyone install this ramshackle Rube Goldberg software when they could IM an MP3? Where's the incentive? <br />What happens when the connection goes down and suddenly you're locked out of your own songs because someone borrowed them? This makes Microsoft's notorious one-machine key WMA files look user-friendly. <br /> <br /><em>A Secure User to User Network <br /> <br />We believe that the Woodstock approach creates a powerful mechanism enabling consumers to discover new music from their most trusted source, their friends. <br /></em> <br />As long as they don't want to listen to it together, and are both online simultaneously. <br /> <br /> <em>Additionally, unlike other P2P solutions, the Woodstock System�s audio file technology is structured as a true User to User network. Only users specifically authorized by the owner of the lending PC can access a lending PC. This is not an open P2P network where anyone around the globe can access your music tracks.This is a secure, private system in which there is no central database or central �nodes� where an index of music tracks can be found. <br /></em> <br />No-one can find anything. That's a feature? <br /> <br /> <em>Only users who have been specifically authorized to borrow tracks from a device can access and see the content or indexes of content on that device. Though the music is streamed in real time, this is different from Internet radio in that only one device can listen to an album at a time. It is a one-to-one streaming technique. One-to-many streaming is fully restricted. For the music industry, it creates a very powerful Digital form of Word of Mouth marketing while legally and ethically respecting the rights of the artists, labels and related copyright holders. <br /></em> <br />Word of mouth needs fan-out to have a chance of working at all. These restraints would kill it dead, assuming anyone was daft enough to install software that stops them playing the songs on their own machine in the first place. <br /> <br /><em>Key Points: <br /> One User at a Time: Only one device can listen to an album containing the audio track at anytime. If someone is borrowing a track, the album cannot be listened to on the device which lent the track, or any other device. <br /></em> <br />Hang on, you lock me out of the whole album now? <br /> <br /><em>Intellectual Property Status <br /> <br />The technologies described are Patent Pending. <br /></em> <br />Good. I hope that stops anyone else doing something equally foolish. <br /> <br />

  <a href="http://boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a> says <i>The entire country of Lichtenstein is available for rent for parties, Bar Mitzvahs, and the like. <br /><blockquote>"The basic idea is that an entire, small country plays host to a conference with all the various possibilities at its disposal," said Roland Buechel, director of the state tourism agency in Liechtenstein, which covers an area of 60 square miles... <br /><p>"It is not envisioned to include the prince or government officials," <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/02/07/offbeat.liechtenstein.rent.reut/index.html">Buechel said.</a> <br /></blockquote></i> <br />If the price is right, the prince will probably co-operate. <br />I once had the very odd experience of visting Astra's head office in Luxembourg - it felt just like a Bond villains lair. Astra is the company that operates the Geosynchronous satellites over Europe for BSkyB and others. <br />I flew into Luxembourg, and was driven out into the countryside. We went though manned security guards, then automatic security gates, and then parked in front of a nice old-looking country house. Inside, we were ushered into a Philippe Starck-style shiny glass and metal conference room, where we met the smooth european executives of the company. <br />Then they gave us the site tour. We went into a huge room with over 200 TV screens on the wall - this was the broadcast ops centre, showing the TV channels going to and from the satellites. In the next room there was a big screen showing satellite schematics, and orbital parmeters. They have 12 satellites in the same slot, all within a few hunderd yards of each other, and they have to manouver them so they stay pointed at all those dishes from this Mission Control centre. Finally, we went outside and saw the 12 hundred-foot high dishes that send the uplink streams. <br />I complimented our hosts on the place and its location. "Oh yes" said one "this is a nice castle - it used to belong to the Prince; he was born here". <br /> <br />Of course, if I wanted to rent a samll country, I'd pick <a href="http://seborga.net/">Seborga</a>

This means I read them less often than I otherwise would - that's why they're in the 'weekly' rather than 'daily' section of my blogroll. <br />(I tidied up some others too. If I messed up your link, let me know).

  <span class="p-name">Derivative works - an alternative to Public domain</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Give the Eldred decision, building new works on public domain ones remains problematic. I'd like to propose an alternative conceptual route. <br />In the word of digital media, the Copyright lobby's focus on copying seems very quaint. Making another copy of a work is trivially easy these days, so I'd like to suggest a modification to the idea of derivative works and the doctrine of first sale. <br />Derivative works should be allowed, as long as the full price of the source work is included in the price, and paid to the Creator of the source work (as long as the purchaser has not already bought it). <br />This avoids the whole commercial/non-commercial dichotomy that makes Creative Commons licenses so complicated, and has the nice property that works that derive from culturally widespread memes will be more attractive to fans. It is a neat answer to <a href="http://www.braxtonian.com/archives/000233.php">Ry Rivard's exponential growth issue</a> and <a href="http://www.seabury.edu/MT/akma/000505.html">AKMA's</a> call: <br /><i>Discredit this decision by exercising our gifts and imaginations in public, without claiming exclusive prerogatives over those ideas� eternal destiny; share music, words, images, performances in person and online; but don�t make the mistake of thinking that Eldred v. Ashcroft closes the case on copyright.</i> <br /> <br />I've discussed it in more detail at <a href="http://mediagora.com">mediAgora</a>

  <div class="e-content">
  
  I was listening to Disc 2 of Pink Floyd's 'Echoes' in the car taking the boys to a movie, and track 1 is of course the very long version of 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond'. <br />Tonight I came across <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/egr-list/message/240">Chris Locke quoting it</a> in a long piece about uncertainty, and it struck me - Chris Locke is the Syd Barrett of Cluetrain. Not sure where that leaves Doc and Dave, let alone the elusive Rick. (He exploded in a bizarre gardening accident?) <br />On the certainty thing, there is a time-honoured physicists joke: <br /> <br />With Newtonian Mechanics, you can't solve the 3-body problem (Sun, Earth, Moon) <br />With Einsteinian (Relativistic) Mechanics, you can't solve the 2-body problem <br />With Quantum Mechanics, you can't solve the 1-body problem (Uncertainty) <br />And Relativistic Quantum mechanics can't solve the 0-body problem (vacuum state). <br /> <br />Now we have computers, we don't need to solve equations any more, we can just run simulations instead, which means we can explore some more interesting problems, but can't know we have solved them. Wolfram's Principle of Computational Equivalence says that the really interesting problems can be solved by programs, but they take as long to run as watching what happens anyway. <br /> <br />"Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way"

  Dorothea also sent a version of <a href="http://craphound.com/down">Down & Out</a> in Microsoft Reader format (.lit). so I tried out Microsoft Reader. <br />First of all, it's only available for Windows, so I couldn't run it on my Macs. <br />The install nagged me about activation. I'm not going there... <br />I can't resize the window. <br />ClearType on my CRT just looks fuzzy and slightly fringed. I bet it's good on an LCD though. <br />Font size choices are very stiff and clunky. I can't change the typeface choice (It's an OK serif face vaguely like Baskerville). <br />It full-justifies and auto-hyphenates the text, but doesn't use dangling hyphens, and even has hyphens hang over page boundaries. Widow and Orphan control seems rudimentary. I got orphans in the licence agreement; if I turn the font size up (which doesn't make it resize the window width to compensate for line length) it orphans the second lines of the quote's titles. I bet it really blows with something more complex. <br />I can't turn this off to get ragged right. This really looks bad in the intro bit with URLs in and the indented contractual bits. <br /> <br />There isn't a way to navigate through the chapters within the text. The complex next/previous page thingie has buttons that look like they should do this , but they are disabled. <br /> <br />The way the Find box pops up and dances about is really nasty. Why does it have to be on top of the text at all? <br /> <br />Looks like the state of the art here hasn't advanced much if at all since the Voyager Books 12 years ago. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.yarinareth.net/caveatlector/archive/week_2003_01_05.html#e001210">Dorothea explains</a> what would be needed to add full OEBPS support to a browser. <br />

  Cory Doctorow's first novel, <a href="http://craphound.com/down">'Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom'</a> is published today. <br />Cory has posted the entire text of the book online for downloading under a Creative Commons licence today too. <br />I really liked the book myself (I <a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2002/09/27/013556.php">reviewed it in September</a>). <br /> <br />Over the New Year break, I had some interesting email conversations with Cory and <a href="http://www.yarinareth.net/caveatlector/">Dorothea Salo</a> about the nature of eBooks. Cory argued that ASCII is best, both because of universality, and also because of the increasing inverse correlation between polished presentation and interesting content (when was the last time you get an HTML email you wanted to read?) <br />I pointed out that before I read his book I munged it into HTML with some regexp's. As Dorothea has previously championed the OEBPS format as having maximum flexibility, I asked her about this, and she heroically created OEBPS-compliant XHTML in very short order. I recommend <a href="http://www.craphound.com/down/Cory_Doctorow_-_Down_and_Out_in_the_Magic_Kingdom.htm#about">her version</a> if you want to read it digitally, but do buy the print book too.

You send them a DVD-R of your movie and $50, and they host the webpage advertising it, and fulfill orders for DVD and VHS copies of it, for $10 a go, with you setting the sales price and being sent the profits. They'd be a great candidate for adopting the <a href="http://mediagora.com">mediAgora</a> model. <br /> <br />I also had a long and interesting conversation with Doc, touching on Digital ID, Zeroconf, mediAgora, Zipf distributions, annotating video, video hyperlinks, the inverse correlation between polished presentation and content, Blogger & Safari and other things I may get around to mentioning later. <br />

  <span class="p-name">QoS suggestion</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.sandhilltech.com/weblog/blogger.html/2002/12/29.html#a369">Frank Paynter</a> and I have been going round this well-trodden route. After reading through it again, I was struck by an idea for a QoS heuristic, based on my previous chats in this area with <a href="http://stuartcheshire.org">Stuart Cheshire</a>. <br /> <br />A key difference between TCP streams and VoIP or other 'real time' streams is that TCP packets always tend toward the size of the maximum permissible packet size for the route (often around 1500 bytes due to Ethernet packet sizes). Real-time packets sacrifice efficiency to achieve lower latency, and typically send smaller packets (the efficiency loss is that the per-packet addressing overhead is a larger proportion of the overall stream). <br /> <br />Stuart has argued that the best QoS algorithm is the simplest - move RT packets to the front of the queue, minimizing their latency. This only needs a single QoS bit. <br /> <br />So here's my proposal: use packet length as a heuristic for latency needs. When queuing, move shorter packets to the front of the queue. <br /> <br />You're only queueing when congestion is involved, so this should have little or no effect on the uncongested case. It will increase the Round Trip Time marginally for TCP, which should make it back off accordingly, and will make TCP-type packets more prone to dropping due to queue overflow (which is the desired effect as TCP adapts to this).

  <span class="p-name">Reputation and Identity</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/misc/digIDthread.html">David</a> coalesced a lot of email on the subject here. Some points. <br />Cash is the original example of a network effect - Metcalf's Law applies to currencies (If you disagree I have some zlotys here for you). <br />Starting a new currency is hard. Paypal basically did it by good usability implementation and a lot of bribery with VC money (the $5 spiffs to new entrants and their introducers, the total absence of fees for individuals until they were hooked and dependent as businesses). <br />Cybercash, eCash et al failed in some ways by doing too good a job of security at the expense of usability, in the same way PGP has, as well as by being too early to work the bribe trick and ride eBay's market. <br />Trusting Paypal is like trusting the US or UK not to inflate the currency too much. One kind of private currency a lot of people got burned by accepting payment in over the last few years was company stock. <br /><a href="http://www.seabury.edu/MT/akma/000399.html#000399">AKMA comments</a> on the distinction between different kinds of reputation - moral versus financial, and then says <i>part of what David�s saying is that credit ratings and credit cards generally work pretty well, and I suspect it�s worth building out from there.</i> <br />This is where I disagree. Credit Cards work OK mostly; credit ratings work really clumsily. People spend inordinate amounts of time and effort doing illogical things to improve their credit profiles. I notice this more than most; as a US resident alien I discovered that my lack of US credit history meant that I could not obtain credit cards at all except on remarkably onorous terms, (eg I deposit $1000, get a $1000 credit line, am charged $20 a month and get an APR of 30%). <br />I got credit card solicitations commensurate with my salary like everyone else (along with the frankly insulting ones), but if I took them up I'd be rejected by the credit bot, and my rating would then have 'rejected' on it too. If I took up 0% credit lines and behaved rationally, paying them off before they expired without penalty, that was a further black mark. The thing to do is take out a loan on whatver terms are offered, make regular payments and wait 5 years. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/lanier/lanier_p5.html">Jaron Lanier</a> said: <br /><i>Real, though miniature, Turing Tests are happening all the time, every day, whenever a person puts up with stupid computer software. <br /> <br />For instance, in the United States, we organize our financial lives in order to look good to the pathetically simplistic computer programs that determine our credit ratings. We borrow money when we don't need to, for example, to feed the type of data to the programs that we know they are programmed to respond to favorably. <br /> <br />In doing this, we make ourselves stupid in order to make the computer software seem smart. In fact we continue to trust the credit rating software even though there has been an epidemic of personal bankruptcies during a time of very low unemployment and great prosperity. <br /> <br />We have caused the Turing test to be passed. There is no epistemological difference between artificial intelligence and the acceptance of badly designed computer software. </i> <br /> <br />How about a distributed reputation system that is the inverse of a credit rating agency -one that collates individuals' experiences with financial institutions and gives them a corresponding rating? That sounds interesting. <br /> <br />Finally, you should all go and read Cory Doctorow's book <a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2002/09/27/013556.php#20020927013556">'Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom'</a> (to be published Jan 9th)- Whuffie is reputation based finance, and the novel examines the implications: <br /><i>Whuffie recaptured the true essence of money: in the old days, if you were broke but respected, you wouldn't starve; contrariwise, if you were rich and hated, no sum could buy you security and peace. By measuring the thing that money really represented -- your personal capital with your friends and neighbors -- you more accurately gauged your success.</i>

This is bogus. One of the great things about markets is that you can trade with people you don't know or trust very well. <br />Try this out at your local farmers market. Walk up to the chap selling fruit & veg, and offer him cash for them. He doesn't know you from (AKM) Adam, yet he'll readily take your cash, and you'll buy his fruit (assuming it isn't mouldy or over-priced in your opinion). <br />The great trick here is cash. A medium of exchange. This is the original economic technology hack, and it is a remarkably good one, as it avoids the whole trust conundrum, or rather, offloads it onto a certifying authority. All the authority certifies is the money, not the parties to the exchange at all. Try paying at the farmers market with a credit card, and see how far that gets you (do take another form of ID with you too). <br /> <br />The succesful online payment company, PayPal, takes this approach, certifying the existence of the money, not the worthiness of the individuals. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.chaum.com/articles/Security_Wthout_Identification.htm">David Chaum's work on anonymous digital cash</a> should not be forgotten here.

  <span class="p-name">Jerome K Jerome on writing, markets & Socialism, 1891</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  I want to write a nice summary of my thinking translating a lot of economists terms like 'non-rivalrous', 'non-excludable', 'substitutable goods' and the like into relevant examples for digital media, but I'm getting tired and I have presents to wrap. Instead, here's an 1891 attempt to explain things: <br /> <br /><p>When men have nothing else to occupy their minds, they take to thinking. Having nothing better to do until B. arrived, I fell to musing.</p> <p>What a wonderful piece of Socialism modern civilisation has become - not the Socialism of the so-called Socialists-a system modelled apparently upon the methods of the convict prison-a system under which each miserable sinner is to be compelled to labour, like a beast of burden, for no personal benefit to himself, but only for the good of the community-a world where there are to be no men, but only numbers-where there is to be no ambition and no hope and no fear,-but the Socialism of free men, working side by side in the common workshop, each one for the wage to which his skill and energy entitle him; the Socialism of responsible, thinking individuals, not of State-directed automata.</p> <p>Here was I, in exchange for the result of some of my labour, going to be taken by Society for a treat, to the middle of Europe and back. Railway lines had been laid over the whole 700 or 800 miles to facilitate my progress; bridges had been built, and tunnels made; an army of engineers, and guards, and signal-men, and porters, and clerks were waiting to take charge of me, and to see to my comfort and safety. All I had to do was to tell Society (here represented by a railway booking-clerk) where I wanted to go, and to step into a carriage; all the rest would be done for me. Books and papers had been written and printed; so that if I wished to beguile the journey by reading, I could do so. At various places on the route, thoughtful Society had taken care to be ready for me with all kinds of refreshment (her sandwiches might be a little fresher, but maybe she thinks new bread injurious for me). When I am tired of travelling and want to rest, I find Society waiting for me with dinner and a comfortable bed, with hot and cold water to wash in and towels to wipe upon. Wherever I go, whatever I need, Society, like the enslaved genii of some Eastern tale, is ready and anxious to help me, to serve me, to do my bidding, to give me enjoyment and pleasure. Society will take me to Ober-Ammergau, will provide for all my wants on the way, and, when I am there, will show me the Passion Play, which she has arranged and rehearsed and will play for my instruction; will bring me back any way I like to come, explaining, by means of her guide-books and histories, everything upon the way that she thinks can interest me; will, while I am absent, carry my messages to those I have left behind me in England, and will bring me theirs in return; will look after me and take care of me and protect me like a mother-as no mother ever could.</p> <p>All that she asks in return is, that I shall do the work she has given me to do. As a man works, so Society deals by him.</p> <p>To me Society says: "You sit at your desk and write, that is all I want you to do. You are not good for much, but you can spin out yards of what you and your friends, I suppose, call literature; and some people seem to enjoy reading it. Very well: you sit there and write this literature, or whatever it is, and keep your mind fixed on that. I will see to everything else for you. I will provide you with writing materials, and books of wit and humour, and paste and scissors, and everything else that may be necessary to you in your trade; and I will feed you and clothe you and lodge you, and I will take you about to places that you wish to go to; and I will see that you have plenty of tobacco and all other things practicable that you may desire-provided that you work well. The more work you do, and the better work you do, the better I shall look after you. You write-that is all I want you to do."</p> <p>"But," I say to Society, "I don't like work; I don't want to work. Why should I be a slave and work?"</p> <p>"All right," answers Society, "don't work. I'm not forcing you. All I say is, that if you don't work for me, I shall not work for you. No work from you, no dinner from me-no holidays, no tobacco."</p> <p>And I decide to be a slave, and work.</p> <p>Society has no notion of paying all men equally. Her great object is to encourage brain. The man who merely works by his muscles she regards as very little superior to the horse or the ox, and provides for him just a little better. But the moment he begins to use his head, and from the labourer rises to the artisan, she begins to raise his wages.</p> <p>Of course hers is a very imperfect method of encouraging thought. She is of the world, and takes a worldly standard of cleverness. To the shallow, showy writer, I fear, she generally pays far more than to the deep and brilliant thinker; and clever roguery seems often more to her liking than honest worth. But her scheme is a right and sound one; her aims and intentions are clear; her methods, on the whole, work fairly well; and every year she grows in judgment.</p> <p>One day she will arrive at perfect wisdom, and will pay each man according to his deserts.</p> <p>But do not be alarmed. This will not happen in our time.</p>

  I was sitting here listening to Christmas Carols, and I'd like to nominate the second verse of 'O come All Ye Faithful' for the worst bit of doggerel in the hymnal. In particular, the line <br /><i>Lo, He abhors not the Virgins womb</i> <br />is dreadful. It is hard to parse, uses obscure words badly, brings up a rather nasty mental image, and doesn't even scan.

  <span class="p-name">Local Toll fix</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Since my $600 AT&T bill for modem use, I have become paranoid about local toll calls. Our reporting of AT&T to the California Public Utilities Commission is evidently getting somewhere; Rosie got a call from the office of the chairman at AT&T over it yesterday. <br /> <br />Anyway, while checking that my new BigZoo calling card access numbers really were local toll-free with SBC, I came up with a solution. When the local carrier is switching you to a toll number, it should play a recorded voice saying 'local toll' (or even better 'local toll 10 cents a minute'). <br />You should be able to turn this off by explict request, but if the local telco did this BY DEFAULT, the chance of people accidentally running up huge dialup modem bills by mistake would be greatly reduced. <br /> <br />Of course, they make money from these mistakes, so it may require regulation to enforce this, but as local toll calls are now competitive, (which is why I was billed the $600 by AT&T, not SBC) SBC could do it to warn you that AT&T was about to bill you. <br /> <br />The real scandal of course is why InterLATA calls (over 17 notional miles within the area code) cost more than my calling card charges me to call the UK per minute. <br /> <br />

  <span class="p-name">Net economics</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.unchartedshores.com/blogger/archive/2002_12_15_archive3.html#90075281">Eric</a>, <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/12/19#debateContd">Doc</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/000979.html">David</a> are discussing economics and the net. <br /> <br />Firstly, I don't understand why commoditizing something is deemed to a be a bad thing. If something is a commodity, it basically means that a market is operating well, and that its price has stabilised at an equilibrium; it is the things that aren't commoditized that are problematic- their values fluctuate wildly through fashion. A commodity business is predictable enough that you can employ MBAs to run it. <br /> <br />If we could commoditize connectivity, that would be great. <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html">Joel's essay on 'Commoditizing your complements'</a> is interesting here, and explains some of the forces that move things towards Open Source or Infrastructure. <br /> <br />Eric says <i>the internet is *truly* economically destructive in the sense that it bends the assumptions of supply and demand to the point that making money gets progressively harder over time (since the public domain chews everything up).</i> <br /> <br />This shows a profound misunderstanding of economic value. Value is created by exchange. If I buy a sushi lunch, I value it more than the $12 it costs me. Conversely the sushi chef values the $12 more than the sushi. If this wasn't true, one of us would not make the trade. Thus, by trading, we have increased the total amount of value in the world. <br /> <br />The net enables these kinds of exchanges to happen more easily, reducing friction and delays, as well as enabling other value-creating ones like this conversation. <br /> <br />Arbitrage is when you move things from one place where they are less valued to another where they are more valued, and keep the differnce (less transport costs). This 'taking between' is the literal meaning of 'entrepreneur'. The net, by easing communication, reduces the opportunities for these kinds of gains. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/19/business/19SCEN.html">This article</a> explains how things play out by using economic data derived from web sales. You get commoditized, low-cost operations, and premium, high-service operations coexisting, just as you do in the real world. <br /> <br />This is what David was getting at with his recording industry example. It is the distribution side that gets squished, as that is all about moving things around. The creating music and discovering artists part is still valuable, but it no longer needs to be tied up with the distribution based companies. Which leads me neatly to <a href="http://mediagora.com">mediAgora</a>.

  <i>It was an Ident-i-Eeze, and was a very naughty and silly thing for Harl to have lying around in his wallet, though it was perfectly understandable. There were so many different ways in which you were required to provide absolute proof of your identity these days that life could easily become extremely tiresome just from that factor alone, never mind the deeper existential problems of trying to function as a coherent consciousness in an epistemologically ambiguous physical universe. Just look at cash point machines, for instance. Queues of people standing around waiting to have their fingerprints read, their retinas scanned, bits of skin scraped from the nape of the neck and undergoing instant (or nearly instant --- a good six or seven seconds in tedious reality) genetic analysis, then having to answer trick questions about members of their family they didn't even remember they had, and about their recorded preferences for tablecloth colours. And that was just to get a bit of spare cash for the weekend. If you were trying to raise a loan for a jetcar, sign a missile treaty or pay an entire restaurant bill things could get really trying. <br /> <br />Hence the Ident-i-Eeze. This encoded every single piece of information about you, your body and your life into one all- purpose machine-readable card that you could then carry around in your wallet, and therefore represented technology's greatest triumph to date over both itself and plain common sense. </i> <br />mostly harmless, 1992

  <span class="p-name">Fool.com: Sony's Death Grip</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  When an <a href="http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2002/foth021202.htm">investment site</a> picks up on how bad DRM is for business, things are looking up: <br /><i>Sony Music Entertainment [announced] the advent of its new "Label Gate" digital rights management (DRM) package. Beginning in 2003, all CDs released from Sony Japan will carry this protection. <br /> <br />Label Gate is a one-two punch: Every track on a protected CD will be encoded, and the customer must use Sony's proprietary software to play back the tracks on a computer. This prevents people from converting the music tracks ("ripping") into other formats, such as MP3 or WAV, and sharing them over the Internet. Sounds pretty good, right? Wrong. Not for consumers, and, ultimately, not for Sony. <br />[...] <br />Unfortunately, this sort of action on Sony's part only hurts consumers --those that legitimately buy their products -- by making listening to music a hassle. Further, it violates the doctrine of Fair Use -- the ability to use a product you have legally purchased in any legal way you see fit. Sony has effectively made it impossible for a user with a couple of computers and an MP3 player to make copies of songs he has legitimately purchased. Further, DRM software actually encourages people to search for "unrestricted" copies of tracks online, through peer-to-peer networks. Unrestricted tracks would allow you to listen to the songs wherever and whenever you please. <br /> <br />If the record companies want to compete with peer-to-peer networks, they're going to have to find a way to give customers fast, inexpensive access to music. Restricting access and hassling customers is bad business, no matter how you look at it.</i>

  <span class="p-name">Iain M Banks knows best</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  In <a href="http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~stefan/culture.html">this 1994 piece</a> he commits a classic error very lucidly. <br /><i> Let me state here a personal conviction that appears, right now, to be profoundly unfashionable; which is that a planned economy can be more productive - and more morally desirable - than one left to market forces. The market is a good example of evolution in action; the try-everything-and-see-what-works approach. This might provide a perfectly morally satisfactory resource-management system so long as there was absolutely no question of any sentient creature ever being treated purely as one of those resources. The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is - without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset - intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings. <br /> <br />It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] - through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others - a kind of synthetic evil. <br /> <br />Intelligence, which is capable of looking farther ahead than the next aggressive mutation, can set up long-term aims and work towards them; the same amount of raw invention that bursts in all directions from the market can be - to some degree - channelled and directed, so that while the market merely shines (and the feudal gutters), the planned lases, reaching out coherently and efficiently towards agreed-on goals. What is vital for such a scheme, however, and what was always missing in the planned economies of our world's experience, is the continual, intimate and decisive participation of the mass of the citizenry in determining these goals, and designing as well as implementing the plans which should lead towards them.</i> <br /> <br />Used to planning plotlines across many galaxies in his novels, Iain completely misses the point that in a market economy, the intelligent planning is done by all the individuals in parallel. Some plans work out better than others, which is fine, and clearly better than us all having to agree the same plan, and stick to that. You can't plan innovation collectively, becasue you don't know what form it will take. <br /> <br />As for 'treating people as resources' - that is exactly what <a href="http://www.osa.ceu.hu/gulag/c.htm">centrally planned economies do</a>. Banks should read <i>the Gulag Archipelago</i> or any of Robert Conquest's histories.

  <span class="p-name">Church Turing halts Domesday doomsday</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2534391.stm">BBC News</a> and <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/12/02/1850212">Slashdot</a> are reporting that the BBC Domesday project has been 'saved for posterity' by emulation. <br /> <br />I worked at the Interactive Television Unit (the BBC department that was founded for the Domesday Project) for the last 3 months of its existence in 1989 before it was spun out into the MultiMedia Corporation in Jan 1990 (I then worked at MMC until 1997, when it became a shell company owned by the stockbrokers, but that's another story). <br /> <br />When we left the BBC, they had all the original video data on Broadcast quality masters, and all the digital data preserved on VAX tapes. They must have thrown those out in the intervening 12 years (which wouldn't surprise me). <br /> <br />I know of two former MMC directors who have CD-ROM backups of the digital data and working Domesday systems. <br /> <br />Which is not to decry the work in emulating it - that is the real long-term answer. This is the technical (as oppossed to the economic) reason why DRM is futile. The Church-Turing thesis (that any universal computer can emulate any other one), when combined with Moore's law (that Computer power doubles every 18 months) means that we will always be able to run old software in emulation. The corollary is that emulation is often the best solution, even compared to recompilation of the original source. As I've <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_07_01_epeus_archive.html#85242004">said</a> <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_05_01_epeus_archive.html#85122582">before</a>, <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> is the most impressive example of this truth, though the 68000 emulator running inside the 'Classic' emulator on OS X is another worthy example.

  Cory points to<a href="http://salon.com/books/feature/2002/11/28/literary/print.html"><i>Literary Devices</i>, a short story by Richard Powers.</a> <br />It's well written, and worth reading. I'll wait while you do.... <br /> <br /> <br />...OK then The problem with it is the author's barely-masked contempt for any real writing online, in his pursuit of the chimerae of dead literature mediated through AI. Had he connected with other living writers online, he would have realised that their conversations were what he was missing, rather than the simulcra he found. The implication at the end that we cannot tell stories except in person, and that new media cannot help at all is so wrong that it jars the rest of the piece.

  Back in May, the Author of Enders Game wrote <a href="http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/everything/2002-05-06.shtml">this article</a>: <br /> <br /><i>The entertainment business is driven by two great devils: greed and terror. <br /> <br />And nowhere do these twin monsters reveal themselves more clearly than in the current demand by the entertainment industry for perpetual copyright and universal copy protection. <br />[...] <br />I make my living from copyright, so you'd think I'd have more sympathy for the music and film industries. After all, I wouldn't appreciate it if somebody started taking my books and letting people read them ... for free! Without paying me each time! <br /> <br />Oh, wait. They already do. In fact, the government does it -- with libraries. <br /> <br />But ordinary citizens do, too. They buy my books and then lend them to friends. They proudly tell me, "Fifteen people have read this copy of your book." <br />[...] <br />The entertainment industry is convinced that digital copying is completely different. If you can get a perfect copy of a cd for free, why would you pay for one? Therefore, they have to eliminate the possibility. <br /> <br />They are so wrong. <br />[...] <br />The only piracy that hurts the publishers is when somebody copies their music and sells it. Otherwise, it's the modern equivalent of singing around the piano. <br /> <br />And I will never, never buy a copy-protected cd. I have too much good music already to need to give in to this paranoid, greedy, self-defeating attempt to keep me from using the cds I buy in the way I choose to use them. <br /> <br />And for those who say, Ah, but would you put your books online where people could download them for free? -- well, my answer is, I not only would, I did. Until the bookstore chains made me stop. <br /> <br />It didn't cost me royalties. It widened my audience. But try persuading a greedy paranoid of that!</i> <br /> <br />

  <span class="p-name">imagine if all radio spectrum was like Airport</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.darwinmag.com/read/swiftkick/column.html?ArticleID=594">David Weinberger is:</a> <br /><i>You can't just start up your own radio station because you might be interfering with, say, the batch of spectrum used to dispatch emergency vehicles. Besides, if everyone started up a radio station, the signals would be overlapping right, left, up and down. So, we need a centralized chokepoint to divide up the spectrum rationally. <br /> <br />Except put that in the past tense. New technology can do real-time negotiation of spectrum, seeking the optimal wavelength the way Internet routers seek the best next hop. Assigning fixed bandwidth necessarily means wasting bandwidth, like keeping cars locked into assigned lanes even if the result is bumper-to-bumper traffic in one lane and empty lanes on either side of it. <br /> <br />In effect, we can do to spectrum what the Internet has done to networks. By putting all the intelligence on the edges, the network can support maximum innovation.</i>

  <span class="p-name">Here's some of what I was reading instead of writing here recently</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/view.html?pg=2">Paul Boutin</a> puts Andrew Odlyzko's point about Hard disks growing faster than network bandwidth into practice. <br /><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/11/20.html#a512">John Udell</a> repeats my point about signed email being the long-term answer to spam. <br /><a href="http://www.newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/media/columns/medialife/n_8034/">Michael Wolff</a> namedrops about hanging with the moguls, but thinks that: <br /><i>the next big thing was that we would all soon find out how unhappy everybody is in the media business. That nobody can enjoy or get satisfaction from working in an uncertain colossus. That there is a dark and growing rage in the ranks. That while we partied, the media business was rebelling from within. It would be pulled apart by a bigness-induced psychosis, as well as by the ever-growing pressure and sure futility of the search for the next big thing. </i> <br /> <br /><a href="http://opinion.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2002/11/17/do1706.xml">Kevin Myers</a> is becoming a censor: <br /><i>...censors these days have become relics of ancient rituals: the guardsmen inspecting the vaults of Westminster searching for more associates of Mr Fawkes, or the tipstaff offering non-existent protection to a judge from a non-existent mob. <br />[...]Although the internet means that off-screen protection is almost impossible to achieve these days, we noble censors can't shirk our duty because of this. So at the one time, being a censor contains the impossible contradictions of being utterly ridiculous yet also being morally vital. </i> <br /> <br /><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/11/19/technology/comdex_chernin/index.htm">Peter Chernin</a> is spouting again: <br /><i> Using terms like "looting," "piracy" and "digital hijacking," Chernin said that the rampant free downloading of copyrighted material is akin to shoplifting. The big difference, however, is that downloading music and movies for free is tolerated. </i> <br />Perhaps if companies like News International hadn't devalued music and movies by making them available 'free' as long as you suffer through advertisements, people's perceptions of their value would be higher. <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/index.jsp?url=view.jsp%3Fpageid=24637">Jim Griffin</a> says something like this, in his argument for nationalizing P2P systems: <br /><i> Making art feel free, without being free, is the history of media. Radio, television, newspapers, magazines � almost all take a loss on distribution.</i> <br /><a href="http://creativecommons.org/features/searls">Doc Searls</a> explains the real problem: <br /><i>In commercial broadcasting, for example, customers and consumers are totally different populations. You and I pay nothing for what we hear on our car radios. We're just consumers. The customers of the stations we hear are the advertisers who buy time. <br /> <br />The same goes for commercial television. Consumers of commercial TV have no economic relationship whatsoever with their local NBC station, with the network, or with the producers of shows. All the "content" is just bait. Chum on the waters. The commercial broadcasting marketplace is a conversation that exists entirely between the media, advertisers and intermediaries such as advertising agencies. <br /> <br />The consumers have zero influence, basically, on commercial television because they pay nothing, and don't have any kind of direct feedback mechanism. And if we put that mechanism in place (as the Net and TiVo threaten to do), guess what happens? The colossal inefficiencies of advertising get exposed. A $100 billion business worldwide is suddenly at risk. <br /> <br />There is negative demand for most TV and radio advertising. It subtracts value for listeners and viewers. That's why TiVo viewers skip over the ads. TiVo isn't exactly Net-native, but it could easily be. And eventually, it will be, if its backers let it survive.</i> <br /> <br /><a href="http://opinion.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2002/11/20/do2003.xml">Andrew Marr met David Hockney:</a> <br /><i>Hockney is a great critic of government interference, from pornography to banning fox hunting, and told me he went on the recent Countryside Alliance demonstration in London. He had marched under a placard with the excellent general sentiment, "End Bossiness Now". But on reflection he thought that perhaps this was a little aggressive, a little peremptory. So he has carefully altered it for the lapel badges he now gives out, which read, rather more wryly and Britishly, "End Bossiness Soon". It made me feel quite patriotic.</i> <br />Perhaps. On the other hand, <a href="http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/11/20/npage20.xml">this report</a> combined with <a href="http://www.samizdata.net/blog/archives/002285.html#002285">these posters</a> do make my joke about being a political exile from England seem less funny. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/holytech_pr.html">Kevin Kelly</a> explains the Universe-as-computer idea, but misses out the subtlety of the 'free will as the halting problem' idea. <br /> <br /><a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0211/20.sony.php">Sony</a> comes up with the most clueless locked-up CD scheme yet. <a href="http://www.seabury.edu/MT/akma/000276.html#000276">AKMA</a> is aghast.

  <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_11_01_epeus_archive.html#85630244">My snarky comments about Gates and his Tablet PC</a> got me some email responses. <br />A semi-submersible options holder of Mountain View writes: <br /><i>I don�t think you get what is being described here. �Gates is talking about annotating a web page with a pen, (which means you can draw arrows, underline things, circle one person in a group picture or whatever) then sending that page to someone. <br /> <br />Weblogging or normal email would allow you to send a link and a comment but that is not the same thing.</i> <br /> <br />I have a javascript toolbar favourite in IE that gets the current selection, opens my weblog tool, pastes it in with attribution and lets me add comments. I can <u>underline</u> with &ltu&gt or whatever. I could grab a screenshot and scribble on it if I want to, but it's a lot less useful. <br />Gates' example is something that's better to give than receive, like voicemail. <br />Getting a monster bitmap of the article with scribbles on, instead of a link to page is not enticing if it isn't coming from the richest man in the world. If it can annotate the page and make a valid HTML page of the result, that's interesting. It's doable as well - have a look at <a href="http://www.quicktopic.com/15/D/qMGnje9VgXnk.html">this QuickTopic version of the Windows Media DRM page</a> <br /> <br />Another correspondent comments: <br /><i>I couldn't pass up the opportunity to point out that in your article on BBBG (Big Bad Bill Gates) using his tablet PC to annotate magazine articles. He probably can't if his tablet incorporates DRM. He'll have an expensive hunk o' plastic and glass, and he'll still be tearing out magazine articles and sending them to his buds.</i> <br />

  <span class="p-name">AlienAid - Guy Fawkes and Halloween -  London, UK to Bay Area, CA, US</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  In the UK around this time, small boys' thoughts turn to explosives. Guy Fawkes Night, or Bonfire Night, on November 5th, is a ritual of burning in effigy Guido Fawkes, the leader of a terrorist gang who were foiled in their attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1604. Fires are lit, potatoes roasted, and fireworks let off with abandon. Preceding this, boys sit by their effigies and ask for 'penny for the guy', to get the funds to buy the fireworks in the first place. <br />Or do they still? The American Halloween, or autumn confectionery begging festival, was making inroads when we left the UK 5 years ago. <br />Here, we carve pumpkins, we dress up for Jerry's annual Halloween party, and tonight we'll dress up again and walk the leafy lanes of Willow Glen with the boys collecting sweets and chocolate from strangers dressed as monsters, then hide it from them the next day so they don't spend the day riding blood sugar rushes and crashes. <br />It was a lot of fun walking the neighbourhood - top tips: <br />Go out between 6 and 8pm; <br />The rule is, if the porch light is on, they have sweets ready and welcome visitors, otherwise, move on; <br />Kerb crawling in an SUV alongside your children running up and down the driveways is gauche.

  <span class="p-name">AlienAid - Telephone Numbers - London, UK to Bay Area, CA, US</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  In the UK, telephone numbers were originally handed out by the Post Office. Local numbers of varying length will connect you to nearby people. For long distance, you dial an area code starting with zero. There were short codes to connect you to nearby exchanges without going long distance, and in the early days of computer BBS's people would dial these in sequence to connect across the country for the price of a local call, ending up with a ridiculously long number. <br />Historically, areas with lots of numbers got a shorter area code. London was 01, <s>Edinburgh</s> Birmingham 021,<i>(thanks Simon)</i>and so on down the pecking order (Sandown, Isle of Wight, was 09834, but the numbers were only 4 digits). When mobile phones and faxes came in, they needed more numbers, so they went through a convoluted transformation scheme. May parents' area code went from 01 to 081 to 0181 to 0208, changing every couple of years. Non-London area codes had a 1 inserted before them. Mobile phones now get distinct numbers starting with 07 or 09, and the cost of calling them is paid by the caller. <br /> <br />In the US, things are different. You have a seven-digit phone number, and a 3-digit area code. The pecking order here is the number of clicks for a rotary phone (and hence dialling time) - add up the digits of the area code, counting 0 as 10 to see how important your area was when they handed them out. Guess where has 212. <br />This scheme has its own logic, but it is not well-coupled with billing. Cellphones have numbers in the area code of the billing address, and calling them costs you more. Local calls are included in your monthly fee. <br />Long distance is by default charged at ridiculously inflated prices. Unless you buy a long distance service plan, you'll be billed a dollar a minute or more. There is no good way of telling what a call will cost you from the number you dial, and you won't find out for a month until you get the bill. <br /> <br />There is one particular trap for the unwary that I fell into recently. Because of the historic size of area codes, some calls to the same area code are not counted as local, but are 'local toll' calls. Unwittingly, I had entered just such a number from the list supplied by my ISP into my computer to dial them when I updated the OS. As any kind of broadband is unobtainable in our area of the 'Capital of Silicon Valley', and as the only people who call after 8 pm are tele-marketers (our family being in a different time zone), I tend to dial into the net and leave the computer connected until I go to bed hours later. <br /> <br />I got the next Phone bill and saw a charge for $77 for local toll calls, to a number in Gilroy. I realised what had happened, changed the number and used the online billing service to complain to AT&T about this bill. No response. <br />I got the next bill. This time there was a charge of $493 for local toll. I called AT&T, escalated my way through customer service for 3 hours, faxed the details to the Disputes department, and now, a few weeks later, they still want nearly $600.

  <span class="p-name">Has Google stopped spidering?</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  With my new AlienAid meme champing at the bit, I've been searching Google for it every so often for the last few days, and seen nothing. <br /> <br />I then tried searching for other people's sites, and found Google has nothing cached newer then midnight on Saturday (search for CNN). <br /> <br />Normally it is only a few hours behind on frequently-updated sites like boingboing, Doc, slashdot, Scripting news or Instapundit, but today they're all frozen in the cache as of Friday. <br /> <br />Google News is still updating, but it is only a subset of mass media sites - the fresh blog news is just not there.

  <span class="p-name">AlienAid - Bacon - London, UK to Bay Area, CA, US</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  In England, there are several kinds of bacon. broadly though, there are two - streaky bacon, and back bacon. <b>Streaky</b> is fatty and shrivels, <b>Back</b> has big crcles of meatiness in it. There are different ways of curing it which make a difference, and if you want great bacon in the UK, go to The Meat Like It Used To Be Co, 50 Cannon Lane, Pinner, HA5 1HW Tel: 020 88664611 <br /> <br />In the US, they butcher the pigs differently, and you never get Back bacon, just very fatty streaky bacon that is halfway to being crackling. However, if you go to <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?country=US&address=3521%20Homestead%20Rd.&city=Santa%20Clara&state=CA&zipcode=95051&homesubmit.x=46&homesubmit.y=9">Cosentinos,</a> you can sometimes find Irish Bacon (imported from Ireland, no less). Or you can buy it <a href="http://www.britishbacon.com/">online by mail order</a>, so you can make proper Bacon Butties (HP sauce is available in many supermarkets). <br />There is also something called 'Canadian Bacon' which seems to be a kind of circular ham, but is not a bad subsitute for back bacon. <br /> <br />But what happens to the missing meaty bits in the US? <br />They get sold as Pork Loin, which is a splendid thing to marinate and barbeque or roast, and usually good value. <br /> <br />

  <span class="p-name">AlienAid - Tea - London, UK to Bay Area, CA, US</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Tea is a core part of British culture. It is almost impossible to visit a household in the UK without being offered a cup of tea, and very impolite to decline one. There are in fact two schools of tea-drinking - the strong cuppa brigade, and the tea aesthetes, or teasthetes. These are best delineated by a splendid vignette (which I am reconstructing from memory) in the otherwise forgettable film 'Mona Lisa', in which Bob Hoskins, playing a rough cockney, is seated in a plush West End hotel. A waiter approaches: <br />'Would sir care for something to drink?' <br />'I'll 'ave a cuppa tea' <br />'Earl Grey or Lapsang Souchong?' <br />'Nah mate, TEA!' <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.booksatoz.com/witsend/tea/orwell.htm">George Orwell</a> explains the 'nice cuppa' better than anyone, while <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A61345">Douglas Adams</a> explains the allure of Earl Grey (note that they differ on the crucial question of milk first or second - I'm with George on this one). <br /> <br />In America, if you are offered tea, what you will get is a cold, sweet drink made from teabags, cooled with ice and with sugar and lemon added. Getting an English-style cup of tea is quite difficult. Most restaurants will provide a teabag and lukewarm water on demand, which doesn't really work. In this part of California green tea is widely available, and this is generally supposed to be made with water that is off the boil. The ubiquity of coffee shops extends some hope, but Starbucks make poor tea, selling a range of teabags called 'Tazo' that trigger the 'Nah mate, TEA!' response in me, which is odd as I generally incline to the teasthete end of the spectrum. However, most supermarkets will sell you Twinings teabags, or even Tetley ones, for you to brew in the privacy of your own home. <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/">Trader Joes</a> have a reasonably priced own-brand range. <br />The real answer for the teasthete is <a href="http://www.peets.com/">Peets Coffee and Tea</a> who sell wonderful leaf tea at reasonable prices. There are several branches in the Bay area, and if you can't find one they'll deliver it. <br /> <br />Making your own is made more difficult by the problem of obtaining a decent electric kettle, as the US's 110 volt system means boiling water takes about twice as long as with the Uk's robust 240 volts, so boiling the kettle on the stove top may be quicker.

  <span class="p-name">AlienAid</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Reading Cory's English Standard Tribe and <a href="http://www.garyturner.net/2002_10_01_archive.html#85606057">about Gary Turner's homesickness for Glasgow</a> reminded me of an idea I had ages ago (pre-blog) but never got round to doing anything about. The idea is to provide helpful mappings between cultures for displaced aliens such as myself. <br />When you move to another country, timezone or even a different area within a country, a lot of your cultural referents are misplaced or disconnected. The obvious ones - your sudden lack of any sense of the geography of the place, or where to go to shop for anything, or what the currency is worth - are usually overcome quickly, but the more subtle ones can lurk for months or years before they bite and give that sudden moment of anomie, alienation or perhaps external prespective. <br />I am great believer in learning from others' experiences, and conversely sharing mine. <br /> <br />Here's the germ of the idea. I'm going to write about some of these cultural disconnects, and put the tag word 'alienaid' along with the topic, and the places I'm translating between in. See above for an example. As 'alienaid' is currently a null search on Google, if I do this and other people join in, searching for alienaid in additon to the terms or locations will give the cultural translation needed. If I get enough repsonses, I'll register alienaided.org and collect them there. <br />

  <span class="p-name">Congestion control for RSS</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Dave Winer, Joel Spolsky and <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002359.php">Phil Ringnalda</a> are discussing the problem of RSS aggregators that check for updates by polling becoming an effective Distributed Denial of Service attack. <br /> <br />As others have said, adopting HTTP's "If-modified-since" timestamp fetch can help here, by only doing a full-page fetch when the RSS has changed. In addition, adopting <a href="http://rfc3229.x42.com/">RFC 3299's</a> way of only sending changes will help reduce the bandwidth of the RSS fetches (I mentioned this back in January when it first came out). <br /> <br />However, this doesn't reduce the number of HTTP setup/teardowns. To do this, the aggregators need to get smarter. They can do this by estimating an update frequency for each feed - something modelled on TCP's congestion control (exponential back-off, with 'no change' treated as congestion) would probably suit well. <br />If the aggregator polls the feed, and finds no changes, it doubles the polling interval. If it polls and finds changes, it decrements the polling interval by the number of changes found multiplied by the overall polling frequency. The lower bound is the maximum polling frequency set by the user (once an hour is common). You could set an upper bound, or let it establish itself which blogs are moribund.

  <span class="p-name">The Fallacy of the Almost-General-Purpose Computer</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000148.html">Ed Felten reports:</a> <br /><i>I was at a conference in Washington, DC on Friday and Saturday. Participants included some people who are reasonably plugged in to the Washington political process. I was stunned to hear one of these folks sum up the Washington conventional wisdom like this: <br /> <br />"The political dialog today is that the general purpose computer is a threat, not only to copyright but to our entire future." <br /> <br />(It's worth noting that he was repeating the views of others rather than offering his own opinion -- and that he had a general-purpose computer open on the table in front of him as he said this!) <br /> <br />If I could take just one concept from computer science and magically implant it into the heads of everybody in Washington -- I mean really implant it, so that they understood the idea and its importance in the same way that computer scientists do -- it would be the role of the general-purpose computer. I would want them to understand, most of all, why there is no such thing as an almost-general-purpose computer.</i> <br /> <br />This is downright scary. I know I talked about <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_03_03_epeus_archive.html#10413423">Hollings outlawing Turing machines,</a> but to hear that this is received wisdom is chilling. <br />

  <span class="p-name">Trust people, not computers!</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1324751">The Economist</a> has an interesting backwards twist on the <a href="http://smallpieces.org">SPLJ thesis</a>. With <a href="http://pronto.digitalidworld.com">DigitalID World</a> opening tomorrow, I wish I could be going. Still, I can read the blogs and heckle via email... <br /> <br /><i><b>If you like surfing the web, it is probably because you believe people are basically good</b> <br /> <br />WHEN economists try to explain why the Internet is more popular in one country than another, they usually point to factors such as the number of PCs, telephone lines or average years of schooling. But something less quantifiable may be more important: trust. This, at least, is the result of a recent study by Jonathan Leland and his colleagues at IBM, which compared 17 countries. <br /> <br />The Internet's anonymity and vastness encourage misrepresentation and fraud. Thus, people who are normally suspicious tend to shun the medium, while more trusting souls embrace it. To test this proposition, the team correlated OECD data on Internet adoption with results from the World Values Survey. One question the latter asks is: �Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?� <br /> <br />The statistical link between trust and Internet adoption turns out to be surprisingly strong. The degree of trust in a society, as measured by the percentage of respondents who answered �yes� to the first part of the question above, explains almost two-thirds of national differences in the percentage of households that have Internet access. Even when controlled for other variables, such as the number of computers, trust remains an important factor.</i>

  <span class="p-name">Gary Loveman Harrahs COO</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Growth and turbulence. Largest casino company in the world. Brought in becasue company was not growing - came up with a strategy based on retail. <br />Simplicity is the answer to turbulence. <br />In 1998 Harrahs had built casinos in newly legal states. No new states, so no growth; competitors moving in with newer stuff. <br />Harrahs had built a great transactional database of customers. Loyalty card rewards customers for spying on their bets, correlating with restaurants. <br />It had been collected, but not used. <br />They had casinos over the whole country, so they wanted to build a national retail brand. <br />Competitors strategy was 'build it and they'll come' - Bellagio $1.8bn - the casino God would build if he had the money. <br /> <br />They pursued a switching strategy instead of a buidl new one - grow what they had, as they couldn't afford to compete on flashness. <br />1. Create a national brand. <br />2. Envelop customers with reasons to be loyal - provide excellent service <br />3. Use decision science to optimise customer profitability <br /> <br />Turning customer promiscuity into customer monogamy. <br />They build Pavlovian systems - driving reactions they want from customers. <br />Made a Marketing manager COO to focus on marketing. Company, not business units, owned the customer. <br />The Casino Owns the customer. (Sound like hacker-speak to me). <br />They have rooms so gamblers can sleep, restaurants so gamblers can eat. <br /> <br />They had 36% of market, but if they could increase by 1% the share price would go up $1.10. By 2001 they moved yp to 42% <br /> <br />People go to casinos to take risks. Their ads show the insides of casinos, not resorts. Found very strong correlation between service quality and return visits, so made sure managers knew this and invested in service. <br /> <br />They really take good care of the chips - count them, track them watch them - tell staff thta the chips are the means, the customers are the ends. Incentive program pays bonus if measured service goes up by 3%, irrespective of financial performance. Staff watch each other, and businesses compete as scores are published. <br /> <br />Need to distinguish between potentially good customers and observed behaviour. They would do epxerimental demographic filtering, send offers to see if they can bring people in. Targetting offers - carefully matching the offers they send to the people based on interest. <br /> <br />Treat all customers differently - good customers get treated better. 3 lines at the buffet - short platinum line, long normal line. <br /> <br />26 million American adults in database. <br /> <br />They have patent protection on doing this because they have mixed up the marketing with technology, and don't expect the patent to stand, but are using it to disrupt competitors. <br /> <br />Seen no impact from internet gambling - doesn't match the experience. <br /> <br />80% of business is slot machines. Slot advantage is 6%; Blackjack is about 1% if you are good, and it is service intensive. Table bets of $25 or less lose money. Harder to collect table game information as not automated. <br />

  Met an incubator - Build a company in 90 days, take it public in 180 days. IPOs made day traders into VCs <br /> <br />Moore's law was faster than companies could adopt - he wanted them to speed up; he found they had overshot technology and tried to keep up with market. <br /> <br />Business cycle does not match the technology cyle - never. Value shows up eventulaly, but not where expected. Moores law is still running. Information revolution is still going, and other ones are too. Next generation growth is happening now, and what you do now will be part of it. <br /> <br />Currently fuzzy subjects like marketing and CRM will become scientific as more data is available. <br /> <br />When the going gets tough, short the future - all speculative stuff gets cut first, whereas the opposite needs to happen. <br /> <br />3 crazy ideas: <br /> <br />1. Zero out your IT budget <br />Or rather, merge it with the R&D budget - no difference between them. As information flow gets richer will be enveloped in information. develop IT wiht the products and services. <br /> <br />2. Manage your business like a portfolio manager <br />Tie yourself to the mast like Ulysses so you can't cheat yourself out of the future in bad times. Weight your investments in short term, mid term and long term. Cut carefully. Buy low and sell high - at least buy low. <br /> <br />3. Invest in next generation of technology infrastructure especially if you are broke. <br />BP invested in a new IT platform, then bought their competitors and put them on the same more efficient system. <br />Make sure you have: <br />Open Standards - don't choose too soon, but make sure all choices are open. <br />Component based architecture - OO techniques are a key part. <br />Separation of process, interface and data. Dont slap everything into HTML. <br /> <br />Getting big ideas is the easy part. The hard part is execution. <br />The new ideas never get through.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  I've been trying to have someone explain this to me for about 2 years now, and this is a little clearer. <br /> <br />He describes it as bringing the edge of the network to where you are. Connecting everything - no doors, barriers walls. The revoltion is integration. Not wildly compelling for consumers - weaving together necessary information. The important question is who controls and owns data and authorises its use. (I thought that might be coming). <br /> <br />He said P&G within 12 months will be putting RFID's on every product so they can track inventory. Less than a penny per chip. <br /> <br />His user examples were the usal weirdness about intelligent agents knowing who was allowed to interrupt you in a meeting depending on who was with you in the meeting becasu they knwo your calendar. <br /> <br />These strange corporate control models are imbued through .NET - maybe thats why I don't get it; I'm already on the edge of the network blogging in the back, with interruptions under my control via iChat, and calenders shared with others here via the net. I don't want to spend time setting policies for it or having them derived from an org chart. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.bgbg.blogspot.com/2002_09_29_bgbg_archive.html#85521671">Another take from Denise</a> <br />

  <span class="p-name">Panel Andy Grove and Clayton Christensen</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Andy Grove Clayton Christensen <br /> <br />CC is very tall, AG is small - for a magazine they had a photo of CC leaning on his shoulder - he took a photo the other way round. <br /> <br />Valley of Death <br /> <br />Grove: Business growth was fuelled by structural transformation - mainframes to PCs - defined it for the whole industry. <br /> <br />that framework lasted 15 years, but it is changing with the Internet redefining software and hardware. <br /> <br />The horrible misjudgments about growth rates, this is due to a lack of understanding of the new framework - we still don't understand it. <br /> <br />It is going to be dominated by intellectual property created in digital form and transmitted in digital form. <br /> <br />We move from a computing world to a connected world where computing is subservient to this connected world, business changes. <br /> <br />Digital pipelines. Copying used to lose quality - attempts to ward of digital copying will fail this is a disruptive technology for everything - publishing, music. <br /> <br />This is immature, and we all have desires fro the other side of the valley. <br /> <br />Moderator: Strategic dissonance and accountability - how do you lead through this kind of transitions? <br /> <br />AG: He was watching the Sopranos while exercising - expecting a book on the management secrets of Tony Soprano. Beset by management challenges all the time, asks his uncle fro help 'you take your bumps, make your mistakes - half the time you are right, half the time you are wrong - enjoy the journey' None of us have an understanding of where we are heading. I don't. Take a shot and clean up the bad ones later and bump off the mangers you should. Try not to get too depressed. Keep your own spirits up even though you don't understand what you are doing. <br /> <br />Mod: How do you keep up? <br /> <br />AG: Partly self discipline, partly deception. The deception becomes reality - if you act confident you become more confident. Do two things. Act on your temporary conviction as if it was real. When you realise you were wrong correct course quickly. <br /> <br />AG: Notes that CC dodges question like politician. <br /> <br />CC: Watching execs launch new businesses. If you look back at companies that have launched successful new disruptive business, it has been by the founder. MBAs from Harvard never do this. Is there something about being the founder that gives you the self-confidence to make an irrational decision that changes direction. A pro manager has to make an evidence-based case, and if you wait for that evidence the game is over. <br /> <br />AG: Agrees 100%. Build your confidence. If you believe you have support of organisation above and below, you can make it happen. It is more likely to happen if you' re a founder and your life is interwoven with the company. <br /> <br />Secondarily, if you funded it you understand implicitly - it is in your skin. If you are an outside manager you are less likely to have confidence in your intuition. It ahs to be intuition as the numbers aren't there. Name examples otherwise? <br /> <br />CC: Multi-divisional companies eg HP LaserJet then InkJet. Dick Hapborn(?) of printer business - he J & J have 183 companies and have launched 4. Only two exceptions. <br /> <br />AG: Hapborn had been <br /> <br />CC: Uncomfortable with the teaching model in the HBS - 2 years from now a 2 year MBA will be regarded as a expensive mainframe, displaced by crummy on the job learning. On the job learning is getting better and more convenient. He did a case study - how could Harvard MBA program be disrupted? The patterns match the already case studies 99 said no 3 said yes. What data would convince you? Harvard's market share amongst CEOs of global 1000 - game over by then. All convincing data are trailing indicators. They crucify students who don't use data, but the teaching model makes managers act after the game is over. Can you teach intuition? <br /> <br />AG: Promote a sense of organisational commotion. Recognise people's aptitude to grasp what cannot be spelled out by data. You have to assume the persona making promotions can grasp this too - hard. What about Brand? <br /> <br />CC: Brand is exclusive - can't go down market. <br /> <br />AG: a degree from Harvard whether you learn anything or not the NPV of earnings is higher. <br /> <br />Mod: networked learning is next gen education. <br /> <br />CC: Spate of horrible accounting practices - Principal Agent theory from conferences. The agents (managers) can't be trusted to carry out the wishes fo the Principals who own the stock. Weight compensation to stock options to align incentives. The shenanigans to inflate stock prices have their root in this theory. Their behaviour is more complex. No hint of scandal at Intel <br /> <br />AG: Stock options are means to salve agency problem for top level managers. When people who own 20% of it give themselves 20 million options to get him over his motivational hurdle? Horrendous distortions of motivation of handful of people. It works with a broad distribution of stock to manangement and employees. Stock owners keep it closer to the company. Look at distribution fo stock options between top 5 officers and general staff. Stock options are not guilty- who you give them to is important. <br /> <br />Boards are moving in the right direction, under duress, but they started from being an advisory body to the CEO, selected by the CEO, rubber stamping his actions, like government scientific advisors. The CEO is supposed to be selected by the board - the other way round. Real world and theory are other way round. <br /> <br />Look at percentage where the Chairman and CEO are separate people. 85% it is the same person. <br /> <br />Mod: disruptive tech for governance? <br /> <br />CC: Not seen anything - feel the problem. resource allocation - senior managers only know what layer below divulges - managers have to struggle to get the info. A professional board is even more filtered; only know what they choose to divulge. More outsiders put even more uninformed people. <br /> <br />AG: Could ask for more subjects to be presented - exposure to more individuals. You can do a lot if you speak up. Board participation should be encouraged by chairman. I smell a disruptive technology coming that will make corporate life a nightmare - governance by shareholder propositions. Business-related propositions on the ballot for votes - eg get Intel out of Flash memory business - now board can make it invalid - proposal will eliminate these obstacles. I can see detailed propositions like this happening - governance is based on shareholders as individuals - institutions hold a large proportion and they will put propositions on strategic direction businesses will be run by shareholders. <br /> <br />Mod: Plebiscitary democracy. <br /> <br />Audience:Intel as brand? Ingredient brand - how was it created, and where is it going Intel Inside? <br /> <br />AG: 12 years ago prod mktg director didn't sell processors directly, so had to brand it indirectly. No matter what, there will always be an intel inside - it may mean things in addition to the microprocessor - communication too. He had to insist on keeping money for it, and argue with customers to put it in - diluting their brand. Now taken for granted. Needs refreshing. <br /> <br />Is the science of management getting in the way of the art of leadership? <br /> <br />CC: People reacting to data from bubble rather than intuition on what is right in the future. A lot of bad intuition from the past few years - how do we foster this. <br /> <br />AG: Business strategy has a problem between the science and the intuition. There is more to running a business than strategy The revolutions in QC and manufacturing techniques were all data driven and statistically driven. the economies have benefited incredibly from embracing the science of manufacturing & QC. Figuring out what to do is important, doing it well is equally important. <br /><a href="http://www.bgbg.blogspot.com/2002_09_29_bgbg_archive.html#85520961">Denise's version</a>

  <span class="p-name">Clayton Christenson - The Innovators Solution</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Clayton Christenson summarizes The Innovators Solution - the non-sequel to The Innovator's Dilemma. <br /> <br />Managers are big users of Theory, but not always consciously. Predicting success for new ventures needs a new theory. <br />Epistemology now - how theory is built - read Kuhn and others to see how theory is made. Initially observation and description. Second phase is categorization - simplifying by clustering. Then you have a Theory of causation. Use the theory to predict, and feed forward - Popperian. <br />Observe, then eliminat anomalies. The big challenge is getting the categories right. <br />IBM used to be a hailed as a success for vertical integration; then when it stumbled the non-integrated companies were hailed - too broad categorizatiion. <br /> <br />A lot of management books are inductive - observe a few cases, state a theory, then look for supporting cases and summarize as a fad. Management reserach is impatient for a one size fits all theory and ignore categorization. <br /> <br />Case study - the big Idea group toy company - hold a big idea hunt in a hired high school in the midwest, and gather any ideas they hear from 30 minute pitch from anyone who comes. If they like the idea by intuition, they'll license it, make a plan and sell it - very successful. A quote from toy CEO 'Toys is a dead category - no new ideas in 15 years'. How can this be? Is the CEO not creative, or does he employ fools? No - it is a process problem. The lack of great ideas is not the constraint. <br /> <br />Ideas bubble up, but get shaped to fit the rules that middle mangers know about - they only want to propose successful ideas - they don't want rejection form senior management - they don't want their judgment questioned. <br /> <br />Sustaining innovations get through, but disruptive ones don't. Pattern recognition is needed for disruptive ideas - you need a theory for recognising this. You need 2 processes - one for sustaining ideas; one for disruptive ones. This way you can be a serial disruptive. <br /> <br />You need to recognise disruptive situations - there is an asymmetry of motivation, which is easier in a new business. Steel example from ID. Minimills started out making bad quality steel, which could only be used for rebar., and the big mills moved up to the more profitable high quality stuff. Minimills had a 20% cost advantage, so they drove the big mills out, then their prices collapsed. This repeated through angle iron, structural steel, and sheet steel. In each case, driving the integrated mills out led to a price collapse - they had to keep moving upmarket to chase the profits, and the big mills moved ahead of them. <br /> <br />When you enter a market, the established competitors are motivated to leave if there is an asymmetry of motivation - if they have a place to move to that is higher margin they will. With a sustaining tech the incumbent will win about 100%. You need to harness the asymmetry. <br /> <br />Current customers are no good for a new opportunity. A type 1 disruption is finding the new, low cost market that the established busines doesn't want. eg personal computer vs minis/mainframe. <br /> <br />Type 2 disruption is compete against non-consumption - find a new plane of competition. Cisco packet switch not good enough from telephony to start with, so market was open. <br /> <br />non consumers are the ideal initial target. Established companies try to improve the disruptive tech to fit their existing markets - vacuum tube manufacturers trying to raise power switching, while Sony found that low power could be used in battery powered radio. A low technical hurdle - it just has to be better than nothing. The existing companies didn't see this happening. <br /> <br />Voice recognition is similar - IBM invested in ViaVoice - someone speaking instead of word processing - target person is someone who already at 80 WPM - needs patience; competing against consumption, and this is a high hurdle. <br /> <br />Simple command-based speech works - phone calls, speech recog for IM chat. Maybe blackberries are next - typing with thumbs is about as good as speech recog. Why did IBM aim at the wrong place? To get funded in IBM they needed big financial projections they needed to justify millions of AAs typing for hours a day to invent a value proposition for the business plan. <br /> <br />Never compete against customers manifest priorities - facilitate them.If it says 'if we can just get the customers to...' that is a red flag. <br />Digital cameras - people used to order double prints, keep a few 98% of photos only get looked at once -we're not virtuous enough to put them in albums. If you just learnt he etch you can get red-eye out of all those image you look at once. <br />Sending images over the net is what people want to do - photos to grandma, but quicker. <br /> <br />College textbooks have overshot the market - 100s of millions spent on online augmentation. What are students trying to get done? They're trying to not have to read the book, so making it easier to take shortcuts - cram.com. Summarize the problems with the textbook they know about. Cram later with less effort. <br /> <br />Market segmentation obscures the targets for innovation - segment by goal, not by demographic. <br /> <br />Categorising of capital is wrong - you want impatience for profit but patience for growth in a disruptive business. Not much in venture funds - they like growth. Some in corporations. <br /> <br />Choosing a team - standard way is to use adjectives like visionary etc. Skills are developed by the problems they have previously wrestled with. In a successful business, the problems they have wrestled with aren't the right kind for new growth companies. Look for experiences needed to be successful in a new business. Need to provide these experiences. <br /> <br />Big co's successfully disrupting - Sony did it 12 times up to 1979 with Walkman - haven't done it since - now all innovations are sustaining. When Morita left in 1980, they stopped. He had a policy of not doing market research. In1982 they hired their first MBA, and then never found new markets afterwards. <br /> <br />Johnson & Johnson acquire early stage device companies that enable new facilities. <br /> <br />How do you compensate a disruptive team in a large organisation? Hasn't seen correlation with stock options - offer excitement of building something big and new.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  We've been asked to think of questions and submit them to the presenters. I want to hear what Clayton Christensen thinks about disruptive technology in the music business. <br /> <br />[later] I asked him, and it is not an industry he has analysed. I've emailed him some studies on the market, so maybe in future.

  <span class="p-name">Digital Choice and Freedom</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  The <a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/files/lofgren_dcfa.pdf">Digital Choice and Freedom Act</a> looks like a Good Thing, - <a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=374">detailed analysis over at lawmeme</a> . Some of its clauses are a little odd: <br /><i>It is now necessary to restore the traditional balance between copyright holders and society, as intended by the 105th Congress. Copyright laws in the digital age must prevent and punish digital pirates without treating every consumer as one. </i> <br /> <br />They don't define the term 'digital pirate', though as this is in the rhetorical preamble that is I suppose understandable. I'd be a lot happier if the loaded terms 'pirate' and 'consumer' weren't in this bit. How about 'It is now necessary to restore the traditional balance between copyright holders and society, as intended by the 105th Congress. Copyright laws in the digital age must prevent and punish unfair republication without treating every customer as a thief. <br /> <br /><i>A "digital work" is any literary work (except a computer program), sound recording or musical work, or a dramatic work, motion picture, or other audiovisual work, in whole or in part in a digital or other nonanalog format.</i> <br /> <br />Why does this definition explicitly exclude computer programs from it's ambit, and what is another nonanalog format? <br /> <br /><i>(a) USE OF LAWFULLY OBTAINED DIGITAL WORKS. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement of copyright for a person who lawfully obtains a copy or phonorecord of a digital work, or who lawfully receives a transmission of a digital work, to reproduce, store, adapt, or access the digital work <br />(1) for archival purposes, if all such archival copies are destroyed or rendered permanently inaccessible in the event that continued possession of the work should cease to be rightful; and <br />(2) in order to perform or display the work, or an adaptation of the work, on a digital media device, if such performance or display is not public. </i> <br /> <br />This is good, but it is not clear that 'adapting' includes editing or incorporating it in another work. What I'd really like to see is an explicit statement that would allow derivative works that require a full lawfully obtained copy of the original work to be purchased to be distributed. This would legitimise a great deal of creative work already being produced, such as additional commentary tracks for DVDs to 'mash-up' mixes and other kinds of media collage that currently are in a grey area

  <span class="p-name">Valenti talks to Dan</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4127963.htm">Jack Valenti talks to Dan Gillmor</a> <br /><i>We went around and around and around on a key question, namely how Hollywood thinks it can protect its films and TV shows from being copied on the Internet while not disrupting people's current ability to time-shift programming and otherwise enjoy what are known as ``fair use'' rights. In the end, he said without fully answering the question, people will have the same rights tomorrow as they have today -- and that preserving those rights is precisely what the entertainment industry has to work out with the technology industry. <br /> <br />He was adamant, however, that technology gear in the future -- including personal computers -- will have to be modified to prevent people from making unauthorized copies. This stance has angered many users of technology and worried some in the industry as well. </i> <br /> <br />That's putting it mildly, Dan. Copying is what computers do. They don't have good concept of 'authority', especially as JV & co can't define it clearly in any case. <br /> <br /><i>Another problem for the entertainment companies is what they're calling the ``analog hole.'' This recognizes the fact that human beings are not digital, so digital programming has to be converted to a format, known as analog, that we can see and hear. If digital programs have copy protection and then are turned into analog formats, the copy protection will be moot, he noted.</i> <br /> <br />Shades of Oedipus and Lear - wilt thou rend thine eyes from their sockets, Mr Valenti? <br /> <br /><i>Next month, the U.S. Supreme Court will take up an important copyright issue of a different kind in a case called Eldred vs. Ashcroft (www.eldred.cc) -- asking whether a recent law extending copyright terms is constitutional. Hollywood, especially the Walt Disney Co., has been among the biggest boosters of these extensions, for obvious reasons. <br /> <br />Well, said Valenti, just read Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to ``promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' There's no ambiguity, he said; ``limited'' is whatever Congress says it is.</i> <br /> <br />Been there, done that, <a href="http://cafeshops.com/cp/store.aspx?s=prosua">made the T-shirt</a>. <br />Lets look at it another way. Can you defend Hollywood movies as 'Science' or 'useful Arts'? Please enumerate their uses. <br /> <br />Can you explain how coloured celluloid is 'writing or discoveries'? <br /> <br />Constitutional literalism cuts both ways, Jack.

  <span class="p-name">Of media and messages</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Let me start by saying I like text. I can read about 5 times as fast as I can listen, so it is efficient for me; writing clearly takes many times longer than verbally extemporising on the same subject, as you go back and revise and clarify (at least, you do if you respect your readers, and want to keep their attention). <br /><a href="http://www.smallpieces.com/">Small Pieces Loosely Joined</a> took David Weinberger the best part of a year to write, and I read it through in 3 hours or so, very efficiently absorbing his thoughts and insights. <br /><br />Conversely, voicemail is appalling - it is easy to leave, but it can take 2 listenings to extract a phone number from a two minute rambling message. <br /><br />Text is great at describing ideas; sound at emotions; pictures at providing overviews of complex data. In each case to do it well takes much effort, but it can be satisficed if there is a conversation—a one to one dialog going on. An IM chat can cope with mis-spellings and bad grammar; a phone call with long pauses and poor word choice, a whiteboard and pen handed back and forth saves hours of drawing, but if you want more than a few people to get it at once, and if you want it to stand for a while, you need to put the work in. <br /><br />Weblogs fit neatly between magazine articles and email on the continuum that runs from books to instant messaging. I'm not sure where the <a href="http://www.afterink.com/archive/2002_09_08_home#81482832">multimedia messages Ted Shelton likes</a> fit into the image continuum from Fine art to whiteboard doodles or where <a href="http://live.curry.com/">the audio weblogs that Adam Curry wants</a> fit between recorded performances and voicemail. <br /><br />Last night I went to see <a href="http://www.jeweljk.com/low/calendar.html">Jewel</a> at <a href="http://mountainwinery.com">The Mountain Winery</a>. Sitting there alone with her guitar, she carried the 500 or so of us there with her through the performance, telling self-deprecating stories, inviting requests, even having a 'stalker' fan pick a song, and then got him to stand next to her and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Studios/6262/lyrics-d.htm#Satellite">hold the lyrics up</a> as she couldn't remember them as it was so obscure. Catch the show if you can. And her <a href="http://www.soulcitycafe.com/"> Soul City Cafe</a> project sounds interesting too.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker_blank/pinker_blank_print.html">Stephen Pinker writes on human nature</a> <br /><i>I think that there is a quasi-religious theory of human nature that is prevalent among pundits and intellectuals, which includes both empirical assumptions about how the mind works and a set of values that people hang on those assumptions. The theory is has three parts. <br /> <br />One is the doctrine of "the blank slate": that we have no inherent talents or temperaments, because the mind is shaped completely by the environment?parenting, culture, and society. <br /> <br />The second is "the noble savage": that evil motives are not inherent to people but come from corrupting social institutions. <br /> <br />The third is "the ghost in the machine", that the most important part of us is somehow independent of our biology, so that our ability to have experiences and make choices can't be explained by our physiological makeup and evolutionary history. <br /> <br />These three idea ideas are increasingly being challenged by the sciences of the mind, brain, genes, and evolution, but they are held as much for their moral and political uplift as for any empirical rationale. People think that these doctrines are preferable on moral grounds and that the alternative is a forbidden territory that we should avoid at all costs.</i> <br /> <br />

  <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/p-03956.html">Ron Duplantis calls opponents of Berman's P2P bill: "A bunch of crybabies!"</a> <br /><i> I'd like one of the cry babies who responded here to answer a <br />couple of questions for me: <br /> <br />1. Do they think that "sharing" copyrighted materials without compensating <br />the authors -- as defined under all laws including fair use ones -- should <br />be illegal? Don't play word games, you know what I mean: if under present <br />law, a copyright holder wishes to be compensated for each copy of his work, <br />should the "sharing" of such a work with someone who does not compensate <br />the author constitute an illegal act by BOTH the sharer and the sharee? Put <br />even another way, if a rock group releases a new CD, you alone buy it, and <br />you "share" it with the world (without compensating the rock group), should <br />any of those actions be considered illegal? If the answer is no, ignore <br />question #2 and feel free to continue to believe in an anarchical world <br />that will never exist.</i> <br /> <br />Yes, this not only should be illegal, it is. However, rather than try to prosecute those doing this under extant law, (no cases have been brought that I am aware of - correct me if I'm wrong) the publishers' lobby is trying to pass a new law to give them a way round due process and the presumption of innocence. The RIAA/Verizon case is another example of trying to avoid the trouble of preparing a case and convincing a judge by going after the ISP. <br /> <br />That a Bill should need <a href=" http://www.house.gov/berman/p2p_faq.html">an FAQ</a> many times longer than <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:h.r.05211:">the original</a> describing its intentions is a pretty good indication that the original is poorly drafted. <br /> <br /><i>2. Technologically-speaking, how would you suggest that those copyright <br />holders stop the illegal "sharing" of their work? As the saying goes, "It's <br />always easier to be an editor than a writer." If you don't like the <br />side-effects of Berman's bill, propose something yourself. </i> <br /> <br /> <br />I would suggest they prosecute individuals whom they can prove to a court are causing significant losses - settling these kinds of things is what courts are for. <br /> <br />I would also suggest that instead of trying to disinvent the open internet, they adopt a model that gives a financial incentive for people who promote sales of their works via internet sharing - it would be significantly cheaper to do this than the sums they sink into semi-legal payola for radio airplay. <br /> <br />Details at <a href="http://mediagora.com">mediAgora</a> <br />

  To church again. 2 bible passages - Luke 17:11-19 - In tests, 9 out of ten cured lepers don't thank you for it. <br />Then Galatians 5:16-24, which I'll quote in full <br /><i>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. <br />For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. <br />But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. <br />Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <br /> Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, <br /> Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. <br /> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, <br /> Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. <br />And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</i> <br />Now the gist of this is pretty obvious, but what did he mean by excoriating 'variance' and 'emulations'? Am I supposed to stop running Mac Classic? Paging Akma... <br />Akma explains: <br /><i>Quickly, Greek "eris" (variance) = conflict, contentiousness" <br />Greek "zhlos" = "jealously, zeal" not quite "envy" (which would be a different word); I suppose the KJV translators sort of took a shot in the twilight. <br /> <br />RSV and ASV give "strife" and "jealousy"</i>

  Last week I proposed a tree of weblogs to bring issues of copyright and freedom to candidates attention in the upcoming elections. I've planted a seed that could grow into that tree with your help. <br /> <br />I propose a blogtag scheme for tracking elections - BlogTheVote[year][country] as one word, then an id for the constituency. For the US elections this would translate to BlogTheVote2002USA [state] [district], so if I were discussing the Coble/Grubb race, I'd add the words BlogTheVote2002USA NC 6 to the entry. If I were commenting on a Senatorial race, I'd leave off the district. Then a Google search for this tag in quotes will find all the tagged discussion of that race. <br /> <br />Congress.org can find your district from your zip code and lists candidates, which is a good starting point. <br /> <br />I've set up an initial weblog entitled <a href="http://prosua.blogspot.com">ProSUA</a> - To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts. If you want to join in and refine the questions for candidates, email me and I'll add you in. Please make state weblogs if your state does not have one yet, and link to your posts about the candidates there. <br /> <br />

  I wrote on Sunday about Radio Caroline (the origin of the music industry's term piracy) and its owner's foray into politics in 1970, where he is credited with helping turn the UK General Election. <br /> <br />In the US, this is harder (all those checks and balances) but still possible. In the next 3 months, all the representatives of the people will be in their home districts, campaigning, holding public meetings, trekking from one place to another to meet their constituents. <br /> <br />What if there was a <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/">'smart mob'</a> waiting for them at each one? <br />Local constituents concerned and informed about the CBDTPA, Coble/Berman, the DMCA and the rest. <br /> <br />Lets set up a tree of weblogs - a top-level campaign one, giving the overview and highlights, then state and regional ones for each election. Brainstorm and hone a set of questions to ask each representative, and publish their responses, and an endorsement/rejection. Get the meeting attendees to bring video cameras and tape recorders and post the Q&A sessions in video and audio too. Sign up flyposters and canvassers. If there isn't an endorsable candidate, come up with a write-in candidate instead. <br /> <br />Instead of arguing about whether programmers or lawyers are doing more, or the details of which licence you release your software under, sign up to the broad principles we all can agree on - that the CBDTPA and Coble-Berman bills are an attempt to overturn the constitution by narrow interests. <br /> <br />Are we likely to win any seats? Probably not. But at the end of it, every representative will be aware of a big constituency who don't want the entertainment industry to have veto rights over the constitution. The DMCA was passed unanimously. Coble-Berman mustn't be. <br /> <br />So, why am I telling you to do this instead of doing it myself? I am a resident alien, and not supposed to get involved in politics - taxation without representation is my lot. You citizens need to do this - they are YOUR representatives. <br /> <br />Go out there and remind them. <br /> <br /><a href="http://aotc.info">AOTC could be a starting point</a> BlogTheVote2002USA

  <span class="p-name">Lesson from History</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Do you know why the RIAA call copying files without their permission 'piracy'? <br /> <br />Back in the 1960s, radio in the UK was completely run by the BBC, the state-licensed monopoly broadcaster. The way round this was to broadcast from outside the UK, after the fashion of Radio Luxembourg. <br /> <br />Radio stations on boats, of which Radio Caroline was the most famous and longest lasting, were called 'pirate radio' because they were operating in international waters, beyond the reach of national laws. <br /> <br />This <a href="http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/historymain.htm">history of Radio Caroline</a> contains this <a href="http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/history/chap4.htm">interesting incident, </a>which may prove inspiring to those currently labelled pirates. <br /> <br /><i>After an earlier incident where Prime Minister Harold Wilson had raged at [Radio Caroline owner] O'Rahilly telling him that he was 'finished', Ronan nursed a healthy hatred of the man. As The Mebo 2 countered its jammed signal a General Election was looming that Labour and Wilson were expected to win easily. O'Rahilly convinced the Swiss that public sympathy for them would be greatly enhanced by renaming the station Radio Caroline and this done he set about blatant on air campaigning against Labour, targeting marginal seats where control could change if only a few hundred voters switched allegiance. Breaking every law in the book concerning politics and the representation of the people, Ronan likened Wilson to Chairman Mao while Caroline battle buses toured marginal wards and thousands of rapidly recruited supporters fly posted millions of posters suggesting that a vote for Labour was akin to voting for a Marxist state. He instigated a rolling phone call campaign where each supporter would recruit by phone, three more supporters and so forth. He arranged for the phone lines into Labour HQ to be jammed by hoax calls. <br /> <br />The government had forgotten or failed to consider that this election was the first in which 18 to 21 year olds could vote and that these people had been impressionable teenagers when Caroline was at the peak of its influence. It was not difficult to motivate them to strike back at the politicians who had so arrogantly ruined their enjoyment. <br /> <br />On the day after the election as the votes were counted, shell shocked Labour politicians found that against all predictions they had lost. For Ronan while the score was not settled, the loss of his station had been partially avenged. Soon after on a London street O'Rahilly was baulked by a careless pedestrian. The two men stared at each other, Ronan recognising Ted Short, a senior Labour politician. Short recognised Ronan and said simply 'It's you. Why did you do it?'. 'Listen baby' replied Ronan using his trademark opening phrase, 'if you hurt Caroline, I hurt you'. </i> <br /> <br />I believe there are a few elections coming up in the US. <br />

  <a href="">Bob Frankston</a> explains why the Economist don't know a market when they see one that doen't fit their phsical goods worldview. <br /> <br /><i>We must address the realities of the new marketplace and assure the ability of connectivity. I expect we'll see a combination of private commodity suppliers of connectivity and municipal services since connectivity is a basic utility like water and electricity.</i> <br /> <br /><a href="http://isen.com/archives/020805.html">David Isenberg quotes Skip Mallete</a> on how this is already happening in Washington State: <br /> <br /><i>Two years ago the Washington State legislature put into a law a provision to allow Public Utility Districts and Rural Port Districts to build fiber infrastructure as wholesale providers. As a result the state association of PUDs formed a non-profit organization to build and maintain a statewide backbone to link all the PUDs together. This backbone, known as NOANET, also provides a link to the Internet at the primary interconnect in downtown Seattle. Most of the PUDs are electric utilities and can justify running fiber to the home as part of their operational needs. The biggest PUD in this effort is in Grant County and has done most of the pioneering effort. Several smaller county PUDs have followed Grant's lead and have begun allowing various service providers to use the FTTH to provide customers a choice of services including telephone, TV, and one whopping Internet service.</i> <br /> <br />I hope 'the Capital of Silicon Valley' is paying attention.

And it's like: "Why don't you people just put in a tomato garden down here? Don't you like fresh air in this diamond mine? How about some zinnias and daisies? You over there, with the carpal tunnel wristbands ? you sure look pale, fella! Don't you like the sunshine?" <br /> <br />They don't like to confront the sweat, and the labor, the human suffering.... Even people who are in the industry don't like to talk about what a massive drag it is, to sit there, grinding code, at 3 AM, as your eyes, and your wrists, and your spine, all slowly give out. Everybody has to come up with these farfetched, elegant, literary metaphors to describe this process. </i> <br />

More frightening, these non-government, for-profit entities would be free to disrupt personal property (namely computers and networks) in their attempts to "enforce copyright" - too bad if legitimate data or activities are affected by such enforcement activities. </i> <br />

  <a href="http://www.cyf-kr.edu.pl/rowery/3men03.html">Jerome K Jerome's advice on bicycles</a> from 100 years ago or so, still applies to present-day technologies: <br /><i>There are two ways you can get exercise out of a bicycle: you can "overhaul" it, or you can ride it. On the whole, I am not sure that a man who takes his pleasure overhauling does not have the best of the bargain. He is independent of the weather and the wind; the state of the roads troubles him not. Give him a screw-hammer, a bundle of rags, an oil-can, and something to sit down upon, and he is happy for the day. He has to put up with certain disadvantages, of course; there is no joy without alloy. He himself always looks like a tinker, and his machine always suggests the idea that, having stolen it, he has tried to disguise it; but as he rarely gets beyond the first milestone with it, this, perhaps, does not much matter. The mistake some people make is in thinking they can get both forms of sport out of the same machine. This is impossible; no machine will stand the double strain. You must make up your mind whether you are going to be an "overhauler" or a rider.</i>

  I've been following the Differential Hermeneutics thread that <a href="http://www.seabury.edu/faculty/akma/blog.html">AKMA</a> has started, and I think I can see what he is getting at, but I'd like to pose a concrete example (being a memetic engineer). <br /> <br />After our trip to church at Easter <a href="http://funnystories.blogspot.com">Andrew</a> and Christopher are firmly convinced that Jesus was resurrected as the Easter Bunny. They claim that this truth was revealed to them in Sunday School that day. <br /> <br />How should I handle this particular interpretation? I hesitate to point Andrew to the Bible directly, and I am aware that Ishtar may be having the last laugh that Mithras is denied (yes, I've been reading a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0806127651/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">History of Babylonia</a> recently, after <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140171991/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">Graves' Greek Myths</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380789035/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">Gaiman's American Gods</a>, so my interpretations are differentially coloured too).

As for the other 10% can you honestly assume all would have bought CDs if there were no file trading?</i> <br />

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://theodoregray.com/BrainRot/">Brain Rot</a> <br />Thought-provoking article on educational software thanks to Aaron: <br /><i>I'm not saying that educational software should encourage mistakes, or have outright flaws, such as buttons that are confusingly labeled and crash the program. But I am saying that programs should be rich enough to allow both right and wrong paths to be followed, and followed in a more than superficial way. <br /> <br />Software can be divided into page-turning vs. simulation-based. Page-turning software, which is very common, allows the student to following only certain pre-determined paths through screens that have been laid out in advance by the authors. Breaking out onto more creative paths is impossible, because there is nothing to break out into: It's a closed box. <br /> <br />Simulation software in contrast has a set of rules and algorithms (the laws of physics; sociological models; geometrical relationships; etc.). It is able to apply these rules to a fairly open-ended set of inputs. Simulation software is inherently more difficult to write; not surprisingly there is little of it out there. In fact, good simulations are so difficult to create that one could almost name all the examples that have ever been done. Page-turning software is incredibly easy to make, and there are countless thousands of titles available, virtually all of very low quality. <br /> <br />Interestingly, while violent video games may be evil, they are largely simulation-based. No page-turning software could hold anyone's attention for the hundreds of hours that video games capture our children. In a good video game, you have a huge world to roam about in, complete with back alleys, multiple levels, and great detail in all the parts. The only problem is that you have to keep killing people to see the next back alley.</i>

  <span class="p-name">DRM Is Theft</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Reports on the Commerce Department Workshop are appearing everywhere. <br />Grant Gross has written <a href="http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/07/18/0155208&tid=6">a good account</a> of the workshop, and <a href="http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/07/18/1644212.shtml?tid=19"> an outline fo the debate</a>. The Register reprinted this, and <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-944668.html">CNET</a> had an account by Declan, who put up <a href="http://www.mccullagh.org/theme/commerce-drm-rountable-july02.html">photos</a> too, as well as a story on Kuro5hin & Slashdot (oddly, an identical one). Most of them printed the "DRM is Theft" slogan of NT Fair Use. I'd like to quote none other than <a href="http://cryptome.org/hrcw-hear.htm">Jack Valenti</a> in support of this idea: <br /><i>The single centralizing principle on which this whole rostrum rests is this: If you cannot own, if what you own cannot be protected, you don't own anything and that goes for Clint Eastwood or the most obscure person in this industry or anybody in any industry. If what you own cannot be protected, you own nothing. <br />[...] <br />The last sentence of the fifth amendment, and I urge all of you law students to read it again, because the fifth amendment is not merely that you can't testify to incriminate yourself. The last sentence says you cannot take anybody's private property, not even the Government, without giving them just compensation for it. It is that "takings" clause that is the heart and muscle of this memorandum by Professor Tribe.</i> <br /> <br />DRM takes control of your computer, and hands it over to those who would sell you music and movies. It's not just the First and Fourth amendments any more.

  <span class="p-name">How I'd present if invited to that panel</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  If I could present arguments as part of the panel, here's what I'd do to illustrate the points from my brief. <br /><b>1. Church-Turing is about Emulation.</b> I'd bring my iBook running OS X, and show it emulating 9 to run a CD-ROM I published 6 years ago. Then I'd show it running Virtual PC, to run another Windows CD I published in the same timeframe. It even emulates a VT-100 so it can run Emacs. <br /> <br />Then, I'd show it running <a href="http://www.macmame.org/">MacMAME</a> to run a Video Game from 20 years ago. That MAME is running the code from the original ROMs, and thinks it is on some custom CPU and graphics card is the point about the futility of a trusted client - the computer industry does not oppose the CBDTPA because we're bloody minded, but because it is the CompSci equivalent of legislating Pi to be 3. <br /> <br />Other emulators such as <a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/">ReBirth or Reason</a> would work too, and are more obviously emulating some other equipment. <br /> <br /><b>2. Editablility.</b> I'd show them how I can edit my kids movies in iMovie or QTPlayer or sequence a CD in iTunes. Then, I'd play the Disney Tarzan DVD that forces you to watch 5 minutes of adverts without being able to fast forward. <br /> <br /><b>3. We are all creators.</b> I'd show them <a href="http://funnystories.blogspot.com.">my first-grade son's webpage</a> and I'd show them one of the funny movies that he directed where he presses a button and turns his brother into a banana. <br /> <br /><b>4. They don't trust their customers.</b> If I can get one, I'd put in a Sony 'protected' CD that deliberately crashes the Mac (a felony in some states) to show exactly how much contempt. <br /> <br /><b>5. Set the markets free.</b> Online, my son could compete for customers with MPAA members. Mandating that the computers we use to express ourselves become playback engines for centrally licensed 'content' would set the US back compared to the rest of the world. Along with many others, I came here to work in the computer industry because it is a free country - free in the sense of liberty not gratis. If they abridge the freedom of speech and free markets with these ideas, the US won't be the magnet anymore. <br /> <br /><b>6. The Internet is a huge boon to free speech</b> -over 2 billion webpages are out there, showing people's thoughts, dreams and stories. Whatever you go looking for, you will find. The Web is Caliban's mirror - when I go there I find a community of intelligent discourse, wry jokes, technological assistance and the greatest works of human history, lovingly transcribed by those who care about them. <br /> <br />Oddly, when Jack Valenti looks there, all he finds are thieves, hucksters and crooks. <br /> <br />------ <br /> <br />Another point. The MPAA or RIAA rep will at some point claim that their industries 'lost Billions' to 'piracy'. These are Enron, Worldcom or Anderson Billions. Ask him who audited them for him, and where they show up on the balance sheet. <br /> <br />

We implemented such controls as are possible in a web-based medium, including spider detection and digital watermarking. But I'm sure I lost more sleep over these issues than Tim O'Reilly did. His experience tells him to trust his customers to do the right thing: pay O'Reilly a fair price for its content, and publicly uphold that social norm. By and large, they do. When O'Reilly content shows up in unauthorized form on the web, it's often customers who first spot it and report it. </i>

  <span class="p-name">Rebooting meadows</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_07_01_archive.html#85221186">Dave</a>, you can't make a meadow from the top down. You need to start with small pieces, and let them loosely join themselves. And you may need ingredients you don't suspect. Here's the beginning of <a href="http://www.kk.org/outofcontrol/ch4-a.html">Kevin Kelly's description of one ingredient needed</a> from his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201483408/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">Out of Control</a>: <br /> <br /><i>As an autumn gray settles, I stand in the middle of one of the last wildflower prairies in America. A slight breeze rustles the tan grass. I close my eyes and say a prayer to Jesus, the God of rebirth and resurrection. Then I bend at the waist, and with a strike of a match, I set the last prairie on fire. It burns like hell. <br /> <br />"The grass of the field alive today is thrown into the oven tomorrow," says the rebirth man. The Gospel passage comes to mind as an eight-foot-high wall of orange fire surges downwind crackling loudly and out of control. The heat from the wisps of dead grass is terrific. I am standing with a flapping rubber mat on a broom handle trying to contain the edges of the wall of fire as it marches across the buff-colored field. I remember another passage: "The new has come, the old is gone." <br /> <br />While the prairie burns, I think of machines. Gone is the old way of machines; come is the reborn nature of machines, a nature more alive than dead. </i> <br /> <br />I love that he has put the whole text up online so I can cite it like this. And, as Janis Ian says below, I'm sure it makes more people <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201483408/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">buy a copy</a>.

  <span class="p-name">Janis Ian on copying</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.janisian.com/article-internet_debacle.html">Janis Ian takes up where Courtney Love left off</a> <br /><i>If you think about it, the music industry should be rejoicing at this new technological advance! Here's a fool-proof way to deliver music to millions who might otherwise would never purchase a CD in a store. The cross-marketing opportunities are unbelievable. It's instantaneous, costs are minimal, shipping non-existant?a staggering vehicle for higher earnings and lower costs. Instead, they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off, bleeding on everyone and making no sense. As an alternative to encrypting everything, and tying up money for years (potentially decades) fighting consumer suits demanding their first amendment rights be protected (which have always gone to the consumer, as witness the availability of blank and unencrypted VHS tapes and casettes), why not take a tip from book publishers and writers? </i> <br /> <br />And <br /><i>One other major point: in the hysteria of the moment, everyone is forgetting the main way an artist becomes successful - exposure. Without exposure, no one comes to shows, no one buys CDs, no one enables you to earn a living doing what you love. Again, from personal experience: in 37 years as a recording artist, I've created 25+ albums for major labels, and I've never once received a royalty check that didn't show I owed them money. So I make the bulk of my living from live touring, playing for 80-1500 people a night, doing my own show. I spend hours each week doing press, writing articles, making sure my website tour information is up to date. Why? Because all of that gives me exposure to an audience that might not come otherwise. So when someone writes and tells me they came to my show because they'd downloaded a song and gotten curious, I am thrilled! </i> <br /> <br />Go over there now and read the whole thing. <br /> <br /> <br />

  <span class="p-name">radio days</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/06/23#oneSolution">Doc</a> said of my idea below <i>I think it wouldn't be radio, exactly. Also that it would preclude the old-fashioned radio art of talking over parts of a tune.</i> <br /> <br />Of course it wouldn't be radio. Internet Radio isn't radio. Let me tell you about what radio means to me. <br /> <br />I grew up in England in the 60s and 70s listening to radio - Listen With Mother on Radio 4 every day - the nice lady would say 'Are you sitting comfortably?' in her perfect RP tones, 'Yes!' I'd reply, leaning forwards toward the set - a big old yellow bakelite and burled wood Valve set my parents had brought back from Sweden, with lots of shortwave bands and European stations marked on it in Swedish, and a special green-glowing valve set into the front to indicate signal strength - 'Good, then I'll begin.' <br /> <br />Radio 4 was on long wave only then, and was used to send shipping forecasts to ships at sea just before every hour. These were hypnotic, like dada poetry, 'Tyne, Dogger, German Bight, seven. Rising more slowly. Good. Channel Light Vessel Automatic, five rising six. Fair. Pip Pip Pip Pip Peeeep. This is BBC Radio 4 It is 1pm Greenwich Mean Time. Here is the news...' <br /> <br />At 12.27 every day, just after the news, and before 'The World at One' did its stentorian current affairs roundup, a panel game would be aired - 'Just a Minute', 'Brain of Britain', 'Round the Horne', later 'The News Quiz ', but always to be hoped for 'I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue', whose sublime improvised silliness satirized the rest of them very well. <br /> <br />Later, when I was 11 or so, I remember lying in bed at 11.30pm with a small transistor set and an earpiece, listening to the first broadcast of 'The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy'. Shortly afterwards I became hooked on the Top 40 chart show, broadcast on Radio 1 on Sunday afternoons for two hours. This was the one and only national chart that mattered, and I wrote down each weeks list in a little notebook, and sat poised at my radio/cassette to record the songs I liked onto tape. Talking over parts of the tune was a curse, and not appreciated at all. <br /> <br />What I did appreciate was Kenny Everret's show on Capital, the London Independent station, which must have taken him most of the week to mix and prepare, combining current and classic music with bizzare sound effects, running gags and more inspired silliness. <br /> <br />These days, I would never think to turn on the radio in the house - it something I listen to while driving, generally KQED, and there are programs there I enjoy, such as 'This American Life', but they aren't part of the cultural fabric of the era for me like the state monopoly radio stations of my youth. <br /> <br />Web radio is no more radio than blogging is journalism - there are some commonalities in the form and the media (sound, words) involved, but the dynamic is going to be different. <br /> <br />Part of what enabled the web to explode was the ability to easily and universally cite a particular page and discuss it, freely and without permission, and with no endorsement implied. If you misrepresent or unfairly attack someone you link to, your readers can follow the link and see for themselves whom they find more persuasive. That <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,53355,00.html">NPR is attempting to disallow this</a> shows a shocking misunderstanding of the power of this new freedom. <br /> <br />This is what we need for other media - a canonical, universal way to refer to a particular piece of music or other recording, that we can excerpt and link to as part of our own creation. Sending compressed copies of tunes synchronously once to a few listeners is imposing the limitations of radio onto a new medium that has the potential to be far more flexible and expressive - it is like early cinema, where a single fixed camera would film a whole play, with the proscenium arch neatly framed in the shot.

  <span class="p-name">Classical delusions</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Given the name of my weblog, I may not in a strong position to make fun of technologists' classical allusions, but I suggest that the Microsoft engineer who came up with <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/770511.asp">Palladium</a> go and read Robert Graves' 'the Greek Myths'. <br /> <br />The Palladium was a statue built by Athene to memorialise her friend Pallas, who she accidentally killed during a tournament. Perhaps this is Microsoft's memorial to the open Internet? <br /> <br />One of the claims they make: <br /><i>Controls your information after you send it . Palladium is being offered to the studios and record labels as a way to distribute music and film with �digital rights management� (DRM). This could allow users to exercise �fair use� (like making personal copies of a CD) and publishers could at least start releasing works that cut a compromise between free and locked-down. But a more interesting possibility is that Palladium could help introduce DRM to business and just plain people. �It�s a funny thing,� says Bill Gates. �We came at this thinking about music, but then we realized that e-mail and documents were far more interesting domains.� For instance, Palladium might allow you to send out e-mail so that no one (or only certain people) can copy it or forward it to others. Or you could create Word documents that could be read only in the next week. In all cases, it would be the user, not Microsoft, who sets these policies.</i> <br /> <br />This is the crux of the hubris. This is about trusting computers more than people. The Palladium hardware/software in the reader's computer becomes your trusted counterparty, not the person reading the document. <br /> <br />Anyone not running Palladium will not see your document at all. While this may be very attractive to Bill Gates, given what his emails have shown of his plans when read out in court, most of us have different needs. <br /> <br />We are more concerned about persuading people to read our thoughts than preventing them, and through bitter experience we trust people with our inner secrets more than computers. <br /> <br />

  <span class="p-name">How to save net radio</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Reading the CARP terms and 17:114 conditions again, I think I see a way to save internet radio and improve it at the same time. <br />The statutory licensing says the radio station can't be interactive, and needs to send song title etc information, but not in advance- you musn't know what is coming up. <br /> <br />In practice, on the radio you'll often hear a song you own - when <a href="http://www.sirensofsong.com/">Sirens of Song</a> is playing Dido, I probably have a higher quality version on my hard drive already. <br /> <br />So how about the radio station sending just an id defining the song to play - a CDDB id would work fine. If the client on my end knows I have it, it plays the local copy; only if I don't have it locally does it tune in to the radio station to stream it. Because of clauses C ii & xi, you'd have to miss the very beginning of the song this way (no advance notification), but you could keep this down to a couple of ping round-trips. <br />As the radio station pays per performance, it only pays for performing songs I don't already have, and saves a chunk of bandwidth as well as fees. <br /> <br />The client can help you buy the songs you don't own as a high-quality download or CD.

  <span class="p-name">CARP decides</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/carp/webcasting_rates_final.html">The Library of Congress's decision on the CARP webcasting rates is up</a> <br /><i>The most significant difference between the CARP's determination and the Librarian's decision is that the Librarian has abandoned the CARP's two-tiered rate structure of 0.14c per performance for 'internet-only' transmissions and 0.07c for each retransmission of a performance in an AM/FM radio broadcast, and has decided that the rate of 0.07c will apply to both types of transmission. Some of the rates for noncommercial broadcasters have also been decreased, and the fee webcasters and broadcasters must pay for the making of ephemeral recordings has been reduced from 9% of the performance fees to 8.8%. The minimum payment for business establishment services was increased to $10,000.</i> <br /> <br />So, the basic structure still stands, the webcasters are still charged huge back royalties,and they still don't have the freedom to offer interactive programming in any meaningful way. The logic of record companies of paying thousands to get airplay on the radio, but trying to extract thousands for wireplay on the net escapes me still. Here are <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/114.html"> the terms of the licence</a>, which have lots of vague clauses about DRM type stuff that look as if they were deliberately written to be only settleable in court at great cost: <br /><i>(v) the transmitting entity cooperates to prevent, to the extent feasible without imposing substantial costs or burdens, a transmission recipient or any other person or entity from automatically scanning the transmitting entity's transmissions alone or together with transmissions by other transmitting entities in order to select a particular sound recording to be transmitted to the transmission recipient, except that the requirement of this clause shall not apply to a satellite digital audio service that is in operation, or that is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, on or before July 31, 1998; </i> <br />Is this an Anti-TiVo clause? <br /> <br /><i>(vi) the transmitting entity takes no affirmative steps to cause or induce the making of a phonorecord by the transmission recipient, and if the technology used by the transmitting entity enables the transmitting entity to limit the making by the transmission recipient of phonorecords of the transmission directly in a digital format, the transmitting entity sets such technology to limit such making of phonorecords to the extent permitted by such technology; <br /> <br />viii) the transmitting entity accommodates and does not interfere with the transmission of technical measures that are widely used by sound recording copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works, and that are technically feasible of being transmitted by the transmitting entity without imposing substantial costs on the transmitting entity or resulting in perceptible aural or visual degradation of the digital signal, except that the requirement of this clause shall not apply to a satellite digital audio service that is in operation, or that is licensed under the authority of the Federal Communications Commission, on or before July 31, 1998, to the extent that such service has designed, developed, or made commitments to procure equipment or technology that is not compatible with such technical measures before such technical measures are widely adopted by sound recording copyright owners;</i> <br /> <br />

  <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992404">Warners release Harry Potter DVD without Macrovision</a> - a good sign. Warners have consistently been more clueful than other media companies, releasing music online in undamaged formats, and not making corrupt CDs that crash computers like Sony. <br /> <br />Stan Liebowitz (cited below) claimed that Macrovison's obvious violations of content creators rights was not DRM. Thus DRM, like Socialism, can be redefined to be what he likes and not what he dislikes. Macrovision is deliberate content damage - degrading video siganls so that the AGC circuitry in VCRs fails. Modern VCRs are <a href="http://www.hrrc.org/html/page158791.html">required by the DMCA </a>to have stupid AGC circuitry so Macrovision still works. <br /> <br />The language there about Professional recorders vs consumer ones could only be more blatant if it mandated a <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/1540.html">DRM helmet</a> or <a href="http://www.brunching.com/features/tuneblock.html">TuneBlock</a>: <br /> <br /><i>Sixth, the exclusion of professional analog video cassette recorders is necessary in order to allow the motion picture, broadcasting, and other legitimate industries and individual businesses to obtain and use equipment that is essential to their normal, lawful business operations. As a further explanation of the types of equipment that are to be subject to this exception, the following factors should be used in evaluating whether a specific product is a "professional'" product: <br /> <br />(1) whether, in the preceding year, only a small number of the devices that are of the same kind, nature, and description were sold to consumers other than professionals employing such devices in a lawful business or industrial use; <br /> <br />(2) whether the device has special features designed for use by professionals employing the device in a lawful business or industrial use; <br /> <br />(3) whether the advertising, promotional and descriptive literature or other materials used to market the device were directed at professionals employing such devices in a lawful business or industrial use; <br /> <br />(4) whether the distribution channels and retail outlets through which the device is distributed and sold are ones used primarily to make sales to professionals employing such devices in a lawful business or industrial use; and <br /> <br />(5) whether the uses to which the device is most commonly put are those associated with the work of professionals employing the device in a lawful business or industrial use.</i> <br /> <br />So amateurs can't copy videotapes, only legitimate professionals. No presumption of innocence. Now they want to apply the same ideas to all computers. Glad to see Warner are smart enough to realise that people might want to pass their DVD signal through a VCR. <br />

  <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/06/13/liebowitz/print.html">Damien Cave inteveriews Stan Liebowitz on DRM</a> It sounds like he is slowly grasping the truth about digital media - that DRM destroys value, but copying doesn't. <br /> <br /><i>The problem is that the number of downloads appears to be larger than the total number of CDs purchased. Worldwide annual downloads, according to estimates from places like Webnoize, would indicate that the number of downloads -- if you assume there are 10 songs on a CD -- is something like five times the total number of CDs sold in the U.S. in a year, and one-and-a-half times the worldwide sales. That's so large that you have to say: Look, if downloads are substitutes [for CDs] in any significant way, we should see really big declines -- unless there's something else going on. [..] <br />It may wind up that people just like to purchase because it's the honest thing to do. There's another possible explanation though, which is something that I'm trying to get harder data on. If we had a degree of copying [now] not that different from in the past, and it's just switched from audiotapes to downloads, then we may not notice an impact on CD sales. <br /></i> <br /> <br />Or perhaps the downloading is a substitute for radio listening, and what it is doing is varying the purchases more - shifting the Pareto distribution away from what the record companies are paying to play on air? <br /> <br /><i>Certainly, if they're going to sell music that you can't make copies of, people aren't likely to pay as much for it. I don't know that the record companies really understand that. I think the pricing that they have for these services doesn't make any sense. </i> <br /> <br />Bingo. <br /> <br /><i>DRM, as I see it, is merely the protection in the software, on a CD or whatever, that would allow micro-payments. It doesn't do this yet, but in principle it could. That's what I view as closer to ideal. They can let you do a lot and you pay a higher price, or let you do only a little in which case you'd be paying a lower price. It solves a lot of peculiar economic problems that arise when you're dealing with intellectual property. If it stopped copying, if it was fairly effective -- it will never stop all the hardcore crackers -- then the copyright owners will get a reasonably good deal and users will get a reasonably good deal. <br /></i> <br />This is missing the point that once it's cracked its cracked. You need economic incentives to operate the right way round, not backwards like this. DRM schemes reduce the value of the content, but are hackable. Thus the only people who can realise the true value are the hackers. You need to reward those who pay, not punish them. <br /> <br /><i><b>The micro-payments idea has been floating around for years and it's never happened. Why do you think it would work and why hasn't it worked so far? </b> <br /> <br />I have to believe the computer people who think that DRM is viable. The micro-payment part is the harder part because the credit card companies won't accept payments as small as micro-payments would need to be. If someone can come along who is able to accept small micro-payments -- one of the credit-card type companies -- then it could be viable. Right now, that's probably the biggest impediment: There's a fixed cost for using a credit card that's bigger than what a lot of these payments would be. </i> <br /> <br />PayPal accepts payments of 1 cent. But that isn't the problem. The problem is that most people don't like micropayments - the mental cost of keeping track of them is more expensive than they are worth - hence the phrase 'nickled and dimed to death'. <br /> <br /><i><b>What makes you so sure that DRM won't turn off consumers and make them focus on the rogue file-sharing services? </b> <br /> <br />If it turns off consumers, they'll have to remove it or lower the price. The people selling these things want to make money, which means they want to give people whatever it is that they want to pay the most for. They want to maximize profits and if they change their product and no one wants to buy it, they'll change it back in a heartbeat. That's the beauty of the market. That's why it can't get too far afield. If they get every consumer mad at them, they'll be in big trouble. </i> <br /> <br />What if they don't change their product, but no-one wants to buy it? <br />

  How it feels to be in a collapsing cartel: <br /><a href="http://www.stretchingthought.com/stories/storyReader$139"> Dan Fendel of the Director's Guild of America</a> <br /><i>That's what we sell, folks. Attention Span. We sell pairs of eyes and ears paying attention to something--a book, a magazine, a movie, a tv show, a website, a radio program, etc. etc. We charge for it in various ways, from admission tickets and buttered popcorn to actually using its very own currency--attention span--to pay for it by making you pay attention to commercials in between our entertaining content, and we give a lot of it away for "free" just for the privilege of trying to monetize it by inspiring a purchase later. <br /> <br />But either way, there's trouble in the Attention Span business we call Show Business[...] <br /> <br />The problem is this: The number of pairs of eyes/ears available to gain attention span from is not growing as fast as the number of venues where such attention span is being sought, and that means that any one of those venues, even the biggest, cannot possibly get the same "market share" it used to get. When there were 3 networks, 9 studios, half-a-dozen major publishing houses and two weekly news magazines, even if you "lost" the "timeslot," you got a LOT of eyes and ears, and you could charge, relatively speaking, a LOT for the privilege of being exposed to them.</i>

  A lot of blog-zagging led me to Brad de-Longe's <a href="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Comments/for_hudson.html">Old Rules for the New Economy</a>: <br /><i><b>After the heroic age, firms make money by giving customers exactly what they want. </b> <br />As long as automobile prices were falling and quality rising rapidly, Henry Ford could do very, very well by riding the leading edge of the technology wave: making a leading-edge car and letting the customer choose the color and the options, as long as the options were zero and the color was black. But after the 1920s Ford got overwhelmed by Alfred P. Sloan's General Motors, which figured out how to retain most of Ford's economies of scale while at the same time proliferating brands, models, styles, and colors to get close to individual consumer demand. Before GM, no one knew what kind of options car buyers really wanted. Today, no one knows what kind of options computer and internet access purchasers really want--and no one will until a computer and communications counterpart emerges to play GM against Microsoft and Intel's version of Ford.</i> <br /> <br />Which reminds me of <a href="http://www.satn.org/archive/2002_06_09_archive.html#85156052">Bob Frankston's on-going campaign.</a> <br /><i>it is important to frame the problem in terms of simple principles: <br /> <br />* <b>Connectivity.</b> This is simply transport without favoring any particular service whether it is voice or the web or television or other data. The underlying transport technologies must enable the creation of new services rather than favoring the old ones. <br />* <b>Advocacy.</b> With the inherent conflict of interests between the transport and service business the only way to assure that the incentives are aligned is to separate the two. Again and again the incumbents demonstrate the lack of incentive.</i> <br /> <br />Indeed, <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/Econ_Articles/broadband_brie.html">Brad's been doing it for years</a>

"So they really need every penny they can get," sniffled Ms. Hosen through a cascade of tears. <br />[...] <br />"I think it is up to the end users of larynxes to prove that they have substantial other non-copyright infringing uses than humming songs for free.

And no one will wonder where all the federal money went...</i> <br /> <br />Dan, here's a challenge for you.

  <b>Fighting Terrorism with Google?</b> <br />A couple of posts on Dave Farber's 'Interesting people' list set this thought off. <br /> <br /><a href="http://lists.elistx.com/archives/interesting-people/200205/msg00146.html"> First this one</a> <br /><i>WASHINGTON - An experimental computer program designed to analyze <br />intelligence gave U.S. Special Forces a mission recommendation in 2000 that <br />some say could have prevented the Sept. 11 attacks. <br /> <br />In truth, though, the CIA does study foreign press, but before Sept. 11 made <br />little use of computers to collect and analyze classified and unclassified <br />information together, which is what Special Forces began doing in 1997, <br />enabling them to get a read-out on the terror cells.</i> <br /> <br />This smells of fish to me. Computers can't analyze intelligence (unless a lot of AI breakthroughs have happened in secret). People can analyze intelligence. Computers can aggregate and help them link and inform each other. <br /> <br />If the 'intelligence community' worked with the kind of hyperlinking tools that the rest of us use to help make Google the best way to find anything, maybe they'd have got somewhere. <br /> <br />The idea of how this works isn't hard to grasp - <a href="http://funnystories.blogspot.com/2002_05_01_funnystories_archive.html#85095380">my 7-year-old son got it straight away </a> - but it is hard to map to an insufficiently public space, like an intranet or (in particular) a hierarchically organised intelligence network that is more concerned with 'need to know' and secrecy classification. <br /> <br />Today, <a href="http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200205/msg00201.html">David Reed suggested</a> that we harness the public: <br /><i>An open/transparent world reduces imagination of potential threats. It also increases the reliability of assessing actual threats. <br /> <br />Which tends to synergize with Moynihan's sound-bite: "Secrecy is for losers". <br /> <br />So here's a radical proposal: openly publish most (if not all) of the information collected by the CIA, NSA, ... to public inspection. Figure out how to avoid compromising sources where needed, but get all of it out, efficiently. Use the Internet, because it scales, rather than TV, print, and Radio, which don't. <br /> <br />This will enable all of civil society to become outsourcers of the costly mundane details of threat management, leaving the difficult and specialized functions to experts with specialized resources. <br /> <br />In this world, terrorist's ability to use the leverage of "unknown" threats and rampant paranoia of their targets to amplify their meager efforts would be dramatically reduced. <br /></i> <br />This would also mean that the emergent properties of Google indexing millions of individual human's links could come into play, as discussed in <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/network/2002/03/08/cory_google.html <br />">Cory's article 'How I learned to stop worrying and love the Panopticon'</a> <br /> <br /><i><b>AltaVista for them, Google for us</b> <br /> <br />But what do they do with all of that data that they collect? Filter it for keywords? Fat chance. The volume of false positives (e.g., people talking about child pornography who aren't child pornographers) far exceeds the volume of actual criminal activity. Even creaky old Lycos gave up on plain-old keyword matching a long, long time ago. <br /> <br />Maybe they manually check it. After all, that approach worked for Yahoo, right? Oh, right, it didn't work. Scratch that. <br /> <br />Then they must use some hybrid approach: human editors and AI (Artificial Intelligence or Almost Implemented, take your pick) working in concert to tweeze out the most relevant material as quickly and efficiently as possible. <br /> <br />Right. AltaVista. <br /> <br />Poor bastards.</i>

  <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/special/input_form.cfm">The US Senate Committee on the Judiciary is collecting comments on the CBTPA</a> <br />here are mine: <br /> <br />The CBDTPA is based on 3 delusions. <br />1.That computers can be prevented from copying. <br />This is wrong. The most basic definition of a computer, described by Alan Turing in 1936, is a device that reads and copies symbols, and modifies its internal state. He showed that anything capable of doing these is a digital computer. This bill would thus outlaw any Universal Turing machine. This includes the DNA copying mechanism in your cells. Stephen Wolfram has just shown that you can create a universal computer using 2 internal states and 5 symbols. Any Universal computer can emulate any other one, so that the software running on it does not know that it is running on the emulation. Consequently, all copy protection can be subverted in this manner. The only way the stated goals of this bill can be achieved is by outlawing computation itself. <br /> <br />2. That copyright law gives a monopoly over copying. <br />A better reading of the law gives a monopoly over redistribution to others, and even this is mitigated by fair use. Preventing copying at source is a huge over-reach, and unconstitutional by any reading. <br /> <br />3. That making something uncopyable increases its value. <br />This is the key mistake from a business point of view. People will pay more for content in a useful form and content that can be copied and transformed is more useful. Ignoring the logical, moral and constitutional issues for a second, this is crazy from a business point of view. <br /> <br /><a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/special/input_form.cfm?comments=1">send yours too</a>

New laws see things differently, though. Now, society as a whole is meaningless.

  A great <a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=227">Defence of Lessig</a> by Ernie the Attorney leads me to <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/jf/MF.pdf">Taking Copy out of Copyright</a> which expresses clearly in legal terms what I have thought for some time - it is not copying that harms content owners, but re-distribution. The 'content' industry count each copy as a foregone full-price sale, which is odd economics. <br />The idea that they can prevent all copying by legally enforced technical means is wrong. What they should be doing is focusing on those who are making money from parallel distribution. <br />A thoughtful <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=33200&cid=3586950">comment by 'pyramid termite'</a> on the <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/05/26/0322239&mode=nested&tid=103">slashdot</a> discussion thread: <br /><i>The reason why organizations such as the mass media and the companies that distribute art were able to lock out live performers is that the "public" was reinvented -- instead of the "public" being anyone a performer could possibly meet, the public became anyone a mass media organization could reach by TV, movies, radio, print, etc. <br /> <br />Now the public is being reinvented again and is becoming anyone the artist or a fan of the art can communicate with. What we are seeing is not simply a war over copyright - it's a war over what the public will be and who will have the right to communicate with it. The mass media would prefer to have a public that remains large with easily controllable desires and means of distribution to it. The new public wants to control its own desires and means of distribution; it wants to be the artist, the publisher and the audience. <br /> <br />There can't be laws to enforce the old mass media copyrights without enforcing the old, outdated mass media model. This is not just a battle over who has the right to distribute a work but who has the right to distribute any work and who can create a public to communicate with. The performers would like to have their public to be anyone they communicate with - the mass media moguls are calling for laws against the technologies that would make this communication impossible.</i>

  2 more quick points on connectivity. <a href="http://www.nandotimes.com/technology/story/413195p-3291008c.html">The FCC just lost on appeal</a> its regulations forcing Regional Bells to open their wires to alternative DSL suppliers: <br /><i>"The commission ... completely failed to consider the relevance of competition in broadband services coming from cable (and to a lesser extent satellite)," Judge Stephen Williams wrote. </i> <br />So here's a thought - can the FCC instead mandate that the Telcos have to give access to their physical poles and conduits , so that someone else can run fibre through them? (Peter Cochrane linked below explains why the telco's won't ever do this). Or would this be something that needs to happen on a local basis? <br /> <br />Secondly, on the 'commodity' argument, Andrew Odlyzko's <a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/history.communications0.pdf">'The History of Communications'</a> is a must read - it shows how communications become fixed-price commodities over time, covering everything from postage to the net. <br /> <br />He also has a detailed <a href="">commentary on Roxann Googin's predictions</a> A couple of snips: <br /> <br /><i> <br />Is the "first mile" a natural monopoly? That is what the failure of the CLECs has led many observers to conclude. Yet there are some contrary indicators. After all, most households do have three separate communication systems, the copper-based one from their ILEC, a coax-based one from their cable TV provider, and a cell phone from a wireless carrier. Thus a much deeper look is needed to understand what is going on, far beyond the scope of this note. A key factor, though, is that change is slow but inevitable. Hence a static analysis of technology choices, without taking account how quickly consumer are likely to move, is bound to be inadequate. <br />[...] <br />Policy makers who are interested in promoting competition could help this move along by forcing those ILECs that have not yet done so to completely sever their ties with cellular carriers. This would be a much simpler move, both technically and politically, than the separation of wireline industry that is widely discussed. <br /> <br />Competition from cellular carriers for voice is likely to force ILECs to concentrate on exploiting their natural advantage in bandwidth, and to emphasize Internet access. (Note again the UK statistics, where internet access traffic on the voice network is fast approaching that of voice itself, especially since the latter figure includes some modem and fax traffic.) This will likely also force them to emphasize broadband, as a way to segment the market, and to create a natural progression path for their customers, towards higher and higher bandwidth. <br />[...] <br />The most promising area for [long distance carriers] is to manage networks that are largely owned by their customers. This will be a huge change, but the IBM example shows that it possible, and also that there is time to do it. The ILECs might be tempted to follow in this same direction, but are less likely to succeed, and may have to resign themselves to operating at lower levels of the networking hierarchy. However, there is likely to be enough opportunity for them even there to thrive.</i>

  <b>Connectivity Convergence</b> <br />I have to admit that reading <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_05_01_archive.html#85105580">Dave Weinberger's</a> live coverage of <a href="http://www.pulver.com/connectivity2002/">Connectivity 2002</a> I wished I coud have been there with <a href="http://sturatcheshire.org">Stuart</a> (as he has explained a lot of networking subtleties to me over the years). <br /> <br />However, the conversation continues through weblogs. Let me try and round up a few points that others have made, helping me to clarify my thoughts. <br /> <br />First, lets split what seemed to be two alternatives into three. The ideal that we're all after is a commoditized 'stupid' packet switching network, with intelligence at the ends in applications. There are two alternative paradigms that are fighting aginst this, and we need to separate them as they attack from different directions (though often in concert). <br /> <br />The first alternative is 'circuit switching' instead of packet switching. This is the bad solution that gets reinvented continuously by people who like thinking about wires. The notion is that there is a continuous connection between two endpoints that is guaranteed to be unbroken. This requires a much 'smarter' (and hence far more costly to implement and maintain) network that keeps data flowing between two nodes and doesn't fail. <br />What this really means is that when it does fail, it can't cope at all - you get hung up on. Examples of this are ATM (instead of TCP), PPPoE (instead of TCP) and 3G wireless (instead of 802.11) and BlueTooth (instead of 802.11). <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/rants/Networkdynamics.html">Cheshire's laws of Network Dynamics</a> summarize it this way: <br /><i><b>For every Network Service there's an equal and opposite Network Disservice</b> <br /> <br />Nothing in networking comes for free, which is a fact many people seem to forget. Any time a network technology offers "guaranteed reliability" and other similar properties, you should ask what it is going to cost you, because it is going to cost you. It may cost you in terms of money, in terms of lower throughput (bandwidth), or in terms of higher delay, but one way or another it is going to cost you something. Nothing comes for free. <br /> <br /><b>1. A guaranteed network service guarantees to be a low quality overpriced service <br />2. For every guarantee there's a corresponding refusal <br />3. For every Network Connection there's a corresponding Network Disconnection</b></i> <br />Or more succinctly in <a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/rants/ATMParadox.html">The ATM Paradox</a> <br /> <br />So I continue to contend (contra <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_05_01_archive.html#85114955">Roxann Googin</a>as cited by Dave) that running this kind of network is a bad business to be in compared to a commodity connectivity one, as its existing fixed costs that can be supported by expensive voice calls are going away can be replaced by a bigger fatter packet-switching network. <a href="http://www.petercochrane.com/opinion/articles/10-2001.htm">Peter Cochrane</a> explains how the Telcos messed up their opportuinity, and summarizes this way: <br /><i>TelCos will never deliver wide-band communications. It is not in their interests to do so; it isn't in their business minds or models. They are into call minutes and billing systems. They are old, gray and don't get it, and they don't intend getting it. <br />2. The cable companies are slightly better, but have a broadcast mindset, where wide-band is an add-on, a kluge, and not a primary business or technology. <br />3. Both (1) and (2) have missed their opportunity, wasted time and money on a vast scale, and are now going bust. Five years ago they could have rolled fiber into the local loop, they had the money and the people back then - now they have neither. </i> <br /> <br />So lets get onto bad paradigm 2 - the broadcast mindset of networks optimised for 'content delivery'. <br />The 'content' industry is really several different pseudo-marketplaces joined together in odd ways through vertical integration. At one end is the VC-like <a href="http://www.satn.org/archive/2002_05_19_archive.html#85116166">fashion business</a> of choosing which movie or pop singer to invest in. <br />Then there is the long chain of distribution selling the resulting works, often controlled by the Studio or Label. <br /> Finally there is the weird inverted marketplace of broadcasting where the audience is sold to advertisers with the 'content' as bait, but then the 'content' used gets manipulated to promote sales through 'payola'. <br />Because of the tangled nature of these shenanigans, it is never clear what the business really is, but it is this group that presents the biggest threat to an open network, as they would like to impose huge restrictions to protect themselves from competition. <br /> <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/05/24#copyrightSmackdown">Doc</a> points to an article attacking Lessig in a crude and formulaic way, assuming that all creativity comes from the centre, and advocating DRM as providing new service to consumers. <br /> <br />Doc then slightly mis-states Lessig's argument in defence. <br /> <br />Lessig isn't saying the net has 'natural' laws; he is saying that the current architecture of the net (the end-to-end, stupid architecture) has these kind of characteristics, but that programmers, not poets, are now the unacknowledged legislators of the world. <br />He explains well that law, code, norms and markets influence behaviour, and appreciates that all of these can be modified, and urges those modfying them to build in and expand the values of openness we currently enjoy. <br /> <br />Finally, I liked <a href="'http://www.satn.org/archive/2002_05_19_archive.html#85113956">David Reed's dicussion of options for funding</a> - I've been reading 'Extreme Programming explained' this week too, and it expresses much the same idea, but applied to coding choices. <br />

  <a href="http://hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_05_01_archive.html#85112146">Dave is trying to explain end-to-end for a putative intelligent senator</a> <br /> <br />There is another way of looking at this that may appeal to regulators, which is a separation of powers issue. <br /> <br />Moving bits is (or should be) a commodity business, and thus should be consistently profitable for the right kind of company (after all, Walmart makes big bucks running a commodity business). The thing that made me uneasy about <a href="http://netparadox.com">Netparadox</a> was the bit that implied you can't make money with a well-designed network. It was a good soundbite, but wrong on a deeper level. <br /> <br />I think that is the wrong message to be sending. You can make money delivering a commodity product well. In fact, you can make more reliable money that way than running a 'content' business, which involves betting large sums on the fickle tastes of the public, then spending larger sums trying to persuade them that they really want to watch your 'content', not someone else's. <br /> <br />If someone owns both businesses, they will be tempted to cheat by making the bit-moving business favour their offerings over other people's. In the long run, this is foolish, as they will undermine the value proposition of the commodity 'moving bits' business, and undermine the real competitiveness of the content <br /> <br />The temptation is, as Dave say, inevitable, but it should be resisted as it will destroy the ongoing low risk business with a steady return in favour of supposed short term gains from the high risk business. (<a href="http://lessig.org/content/standard/0,1902,28036,00.html">Lessig</a> and <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/04/30/strategyTax">Winer</a> call this 'strategy tax'). <br /> <br />If there is competition in provision, this will work itself out, as the companies that make this kind of mistake will be dumped in favour of smarter ones. <br /> <br />The problem is when there aren't available alternatives because of a regulatory monopoly (only one local phone co; only one cable co). This is where regulation to ensure separation of powers comes in. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.prospect.org/print/V11/10/lessig-l.html">Lessig argues convincingly</a> that it was this kind of regulation to ensure open access to the phone network that allowed the net to grow in the first place: <br /><i>But there is one part of the Internet where end-to-end is more than just a norm. Here the principle has the force of law, and the network owner cannot favor one kind of content over another or prefer one form of service over another. Instead the network owner must keep its network open for any application or use the customers might demand. Competitors must be allowed to interconnect; consumers must be allowed to try new uses. In this part of the Internet, "open access" is the rule. <br /> <br />This part of the Internet is--ironically enough--the telephone network, where because of increasing regulation imposed by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in the 1970s--leading to a breakup of AT&T by the Justice Department in 1984 and culminating with the Telecommunications Act of 1996--the old telephone network has been replaced with a new one over which the owner has very little control. Instead, the FCC spends an extraordinary amount of effort making sure the telephone lines remain open to innovators and consumers on terms analogous to the terms required by an end-to-end principle: nondiscrimination and a right to access. <br /> <br />The FCC is convinced that this regulatory burden is severe and costly to maintain. And no doubt it is costly. But the question is not simply how much the regulation costs; it is also about its benefit. What is the benefit of effectively enforcing end-to-end on the telephone system? <br /> <br />In my view, the benefit has been the Internet. Though the Internet proper was initially a network among universities, had it not been for the ability of ordinary consumers to connect to the Internet, that network would have gone nowhere. (Universities are fun, but they aren't enough to fuel commercial revolutions.) Ordinary consumers connected to the Net across phone lines. And had it not been for the open-access rules that the government imposed upon telephones, the telephone companies would most likely have behaved just as every network owner in history has behaved--to control access and use architecture to minimize competition. If it hadn't been as cheap to dial a local bulletin-board system (BBS) as it was to dial a local friend; had the Baby Bells kept the power to force customers to a Baby Bell ISP; had the government not insisted that competitors be connected and had it not policed pricing to ensure nondiscrimination--had it not, in short, used the power of law to force a competitive neutrality onto the telephone system, the telephone system would not have inspired the extraordinary innovation that it did. <br /> <br />By keeping the network neutral, by keeping it open to innovation, the FCC has made possible the extraordinary innovation that the Internet has produced. Open access was the rule; a regulation produced that rule.</i> <br /> <br />Lots more detail on this in Lessig's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375505784/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">The Future of Ideas</a>

  <A href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_05_01_archive.html#85105580">Dave is live-blogging Connectivity 2002</a> <br />One thing they are talking about is email & privacy. <br /> <br />Here's my 3 stage plan for the elimination of spam through email user experience improvement: <br /> <br />1. Integrate PGP signing and encryption so that they happen automatically, and are on by default. Adopt one of the various proposals for Key exchange through email interaction too. Yes, this may be less than perfectly secure but its a damn sight better than spoofable headers; hard core crypto heads can validate keys through side channels and mark them that way in address book (see 3 below). <br /> <br />2. Provide subtle UI cueing for different priorities - Bigger bolder type for high priorities, smaller lighter type for low priorities. Think how a print Newspaper uses type size to convey story importance, but get a smart visual designer to come up with the actual mappings. Have indicators for verified signed and encrypted mails. <br /> <br />3. Create a fuzzy-logic prioritization engine, that takes into account lots of info about the mail (Think trust metrics). Key input values are: <br />-Who is this from? (verified signed mail > someone you've sent mail to > someone in address book > random user) <br /> Ideally, have a trust hierarchy in the address book - like a fuzzy kill file that can reward as well as punish <br />-Who is this to? (uses my public key > addressed just to me > me as part of CC list > mailing list address) <br />-Does it contain money? (Paypal emails etc). <br />-Does it match keyword/semantic signatures I like or dislike (eg I would like 'QuickTime' and dislike 'millions of email addresses') <br />-Has it been sitting in my inbox a while and I still haven't read it? <br />-etc. <br /> <br />The point of this is that each of these stages is a fluid extension of existing UI and features that is useful in itself, and capable of further refinement, but acting in concert they provide a way for email to hold back the tragedy of the commons that spam represents. <br /> <br />

  <a href="http://www.seabury.edu/faculty/akma/blog.html">Akma</a>, who was kind enough recently to confirm my appointment as Dean of Memetic Engineering and Reader of Thoughts at the University of Blogaria, has <a href="http://www.seabury.edu/faculty/akma/2002_05_19_blogarch.html#76742280">been thinking about authenticity, complexity and binary thought (us v. them)</a>. <br /> <br />Symmetrically, I attended church today, to see some friends confirmed, and also saw the priest officially installed. <br />I was struck by the formal and contractual sounding nature of the installation, (it was very like installing software - a licence we could reject as parishioners, but then have no priest) and also by the 'binary' (in AKMA's terms) discussion of Christian doctrine as part of the confirmation - the idea that we have a common heritage in the Book of Common Prayer, and that one might suffer for being identified as a Christian. I know persecution casts a long shadow, but the small Anglican congregation gathered in the hills above Silicon Valley seems very far from Rome. <br /> <br />On a related note, I just ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1579550088/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">Stephen Wolfram's <i>A New Kind of Science</i></a>, which claims that complexity is explicable (or at least able to be generated) from simple rules. <br /> <br />I'm looking forward to reading this tome, and I will let Akma know if I recommend its memes. I do agree that appreciating compexity and eschewing a zero-sum viewpoint is important, but to assert that complex outcomes require complex explanations (which Akma does not, directly) is another common logical flaw. Occam's razor needs to be kept sharp too.

  <b>Eisnerwatch</b> <br /><a href="http://www.fortune.com/indext.jhtml?channel=print_article.jhtml&doc_id=207975">Fortune</a> has a shallow article on the content clone wars, full of muddy zero-sum thinking. <br /><i>Michael Eisner loves his iPod. "It's one of the most fabulous things I've seen in the past couple of years," he says. Eisner has no problem with the technology itself, but he deplores the fact that people are using it to avoid paying for Disney products, in effect stealing from the company. "Nothing about technology is threatening or upsetting or negative," he insists. "This is simply about conscious behavior, about right and wrong, and I just don't understand the enormous tidal wave of rhetoric that this issue has created from the so-called technology side. Shakespeare would find it interesting." </i> <br /> <br />Rhetoric from the technology side? Scroll down a bit for the choice rhetoric from the copyright horders... <br /> <br />Anyway, <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/ejournal/3276357.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp">Dan</a> says; <br /><i>Articles like this are infuriating. They cast the debate in binary terms, industry versus industry, as if that's really the issue. It isn't. <br /> <br />Guess who's missing from the story, and all too often from the debate? That's right, the customers. You. Me.</i> <br /> <br />Not only the customers, but also the creators. <br /> <br /><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/05/15#lf4498162d588d436f63224741f538268">Dave</a> says it makes Jobs look clueless, but I disagree. Jobs is quoted as saying: <br /><i>"To say this intractable technology problem is going to be solved by something in the back pockets of technology companies, and they are not sharing it, is unbelievable. This is an important issue, and it's not going to be solved by threatening rhetoric. It's going to be solved by a computer scientist who has an incredibly original idea. We just don't know who or when." </i> <br />Which Dave presumably takes to mean that Jobs believes that the intractable problem of selective copy prevention can be solved. I think he means that the meta-problem of the distribution of creative works and paying their creators can be solved. <br />

  <a href="http://www.well.com/~doctorow/gilmoreintel.txt">John Glimore explains the problem with Intel's appeasement</a> <br /> <br /><i>Intel builds machines that process data. "Content" is just data. <br />Every piece of data that an Intel processor or networking component <br />handles is copyrighted by somebody, under the Berne Convention. It's <br />all "content". You could talk about "protecting data" but people <br />would realize that preventing it from being copied does not "protect" <br />their data. Frequently you NEED to copy your data -- e.g. onto a <br />backup tape -- to protect it. So instead you use this made-up word <br />"content". Since nobody knows a definition for "content", you can say <br />the most outrageous things about it and get away with it. <br /> <br />Intel's chips have no way to tell what permission that individual chip <br />owner has under the copyright law, for many reasons. (The laws <br />change, copyrights expire, individuals or companies get more rights <br />than the general public does because they signed licenses, there are <br />things that everyone has the legal right to do with data whether or <br />not it is copyrighted, etc etc etc.) <br /> <br />If Intel really thought that there was a "need to protect content", it <br />would have built features into its chips to make sure that none of <br />Intel's OWN chip designs, hardware designs, software, documents, trade <br />secrets, and other intellectual property could ever be stolen or <br />copied using Intel equipment. That's Intel's first and foremost <br />interest in intellectual property protection -- but it has expended <br />zero effort toward "fixing" its chips to provide technical barriers <br />against such unlawful copying. Therefore I discount the claim that <br />Intel sees a "need to protect content". <br /> <br />What Intel is doing is a cynical scheme to buy off an oligopoly.</i> <br /> <br />Also, Intel has a vested interest in people buying new hardware, as that is what they sell. They have done very well for decades by making the stuff faster and better so people want to upgrade.They should stick to this, instead of requiring an upgrade to get a machine that plays what it should. This is likely to backfire hard, as peoepl wil prefer the older unrestricted hardware over the new.

  <span class="p-name">Teaching children to program</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Doc pointed me at David Scott Williams' <a href="http://dustyscript.sourceforge.net/">DustyScript</a> idea. <br />I sent him a brief email saying I thought it was missing the point, and suggesting existing software tools, but made a hash of describing the point, so I'll try again here. <br /> <br />Being a good programmer is not about the language you use, it is about the way you think, and the way you approach problems. You need to be able to keep high-level and low level goals in mind at once, to analyse and model situations, to express the model in rules, and to adapt the rules to new situations. Its perfectly possibel to write good clear code in almost any language, just as you can write bad, unclear code in any language <a href="http://www.if.insa-lyon.fr/eleves/jquelin/quadri.html">or even 4 at once</a> <br /> <br />Young children are fantastically good at learning languages by example, but often not good at predicate logic or deductive reasoning, which takes a lot of training. (As an aside, the book <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684853671/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">Reading Reflex</a> applies this insight to teaching reading - instead of teaching deductive rules parrot fashion, it groups different representations of the same sound and gets the children to work through them until they derive an unconscious model that way). <br /> <br />The best 'programming' exercise with small children is the 'I am a robot' game. You play their robot slave, and do what you are told, but very literally, and in small stages, with 'error messages' returned in a robot voice. Just getting you to walk from the sofa to the bedroom can take ages and they love it. They naturally want to be the simple-minded robot too (just make sure they don't get too attached to it, or they may end up working in <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_05_01_archive.html#85079704"> telephone support</a>). <br /> <br />I've seen a huge amount of 'educational' software - I used to work in the CD-ROM business, and I buy up remaindered CD's from Marshalls for my 2 boys and watch how they use them. Most of them are dross, with the same few ideas (Pelmanism, missing words etc.) recycled with a different character or brand attached. Some have genuine insight, and I can see them learning to reason using them. Here are a selection: <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005LBVU/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">Logical Journey of the Zoombinis</a> is a wonderful introduction to deductive logic through a compelling game. It was <a href="http://www.terc.edu/handson/s96/zoom.html"> designed with this in mind</a> and my boys have been playing this since they were 3, and are still enjoying it now at 5 and 7 (as do I). <br /> <br />The Pajama Sam series of adventures from Humongous are good at teaching the global/local focus, but one that is great fun and teaches valuable debugging skills is <a href="http://www.humongous.com/asp/character.asp?pageWord=Sam&content=Games&productID=04-12455">Pajama Sam's SockWorks</a> which features a long series of machines that have socks in them that you have to get into the right coloured baskets. As you can also build your own puzzles, the idea of solvable and unsolvable problems naturally comes up. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.riverdeep.net/products/science/thinkin_sci_zap.jhtml">Zap!</a> is another great game that teaches by stealth. You have to help 3 wisecracking cartoon charcters to fix their electrical, optical and audio-visual gadgets to get their show on the road. It manages to include a compelte circuit simulator, an optical workbench simulator and sound environment simulator, and still be lots of fun for Kindergarten children. <br /> <br />To teach programming concepts without writing textual code, <a href="http://www.kidsdomain.com/games/cocoa/download.html">Cocoa</a> is perfect (if you have a Mac). It is a tool that enables you to create 2d video games by drawing the characters and defining what happens when they encounter each other by example. Andrew has made about 65 games with this, some original, some homages to TV programs or his brother's films. <br /> <br />Finally, if you want a comprehensible textual language, use <a href="http://runrev.com">Runtime Revolution</a>, whose language Transcript is based on the old Apple HyperCard language, and as such has <a href="http://runrev.com/revolution/info/compare/visualbasic/vb-vs-rev/languages.html">completely human-readable programs.</a> This is what I plan to get Andrew into next.

Experienced file sharers were 75 percent more likely than the average online music fan to have increased their music spending levels."</i> <br /> <br /><a href="http://wilcoworld.net/qtlp.html">Wilco</a> turned up very high in the charts after making their album available online. <br /> <br />Now I want a survey about the effect of 'protected' CDs on sales.

  <a href="http://www.reason.com/0205/fe.mg.hollywood.shtml">Mike Godwin's Content vs Tech Factions piece is up at Reason</a> <br /><i>One way to understand the conflict between the Content Faction and the Tech Faction is to look at how they describe their customers. For the content industries, they're "consumers." By contrast, the information technology companies talk about "users." <br /> <br />If you see people as consumers, you control access to what you offer, and you do everything you can to prevent theft, for the same reason supermarkets have cameras by the door and bookstores have electronic theft detectors. Allowing people to take stuff for free is inconsistent with your business model. <br /> <br />But if you see people as users, you want to give them more features and power at cheaper prices. The impulse to empower users was at the heart of the microcomputer revolution: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak wanted to put computing power into ordinary people's hands, and that's why they founded Apple Computer. If this is your approach -- enabling people to do new things -- it's hard to adjust to the idea of building in limitations.</i> <br /> <br />This is OK as far as it goes, but what the CBDTPA is proposing isn't electronic theft detectors, it is the equivalent of mandatory confiscation by armed security guards of all bags and clothing that might be used to carry stolen goods from anyone walking within 300 feet of the mall. This would ensure no-one stole CDs from Tower Records, but it would significantly limit the numbers who would want to shop at the mall.

It doesn't call for this kind of havering.

  <span class="p-name">Silent Theft</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.silenttheft.com/intro.htm">Silent Theft</a> is a new book campaigning for the concept of the commons: <br /><i>It should be stressed that protecting the commons is about maintaining a balance, not bashing business. It is self-evident that we need markets. It is far less clear -- particularly to businesses operating within markets -- that we also need commons. A society in which every transaction must be mediated by the market, in which everything is privately owned and strictly controlled, will come to resemble a medieval society -- a world of balkanized fiefdoms in which every minor satrap demands tribute for the right to cross his land or ford his streams. The flow of commerce and ideas -- and the sustainability of innovation and democratic culture - will be seriously impeded. Furthermore, such a market-dominated society is not likely to cultivate the sense of trust and shared commitments that any functioning society must have. <br /> <br />So the issue is not market versus commons. The issue is how to set equitable and appropriate boundaries between the two realms - semi-permeable membranes --so that the market and the commons can each retain its integrity while invigorating the other. That equilibrium is now out of balance as businesses try to exploit all available resources, including those that everyone owns and uses in common.</i> <br />This sounds promising; there is a problem of commons over-reach too...

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6033">Setting Fire to Hollywood's Plans for the Net: The GeekPAC Story</a> <br /> <br /><i>As a creative commons, the Net suppports countless new opportunities for Hollywood. But three of Hollywood's leaders--Michael Eisner of Disney, Hillary Rosen of the RIAA and Jack Valenti of the MPAA--have chosen instead to regard the Net as a threat and its citizens as thieves. They want to replace the Net's commons with a plumbing system for "content" entirely managed and controlled from the supply side. They are not interested in seeing billions of passive and voiceless "consumers" turn into active and vocal customers. <br /> <br />And so we find ourselves in a kind of war--not just between two interest groups, but between two fundamentally different ways of understanding the Net itself. One sees it as a commons. The other sees it as a distribution system. One wants to protect it and let it grow. The other wants to manage and exploit it. One expects innovation and market forces to solve the business problems that naturally accompany growth. The other wants government to protect established industries against exactly those kinds of problems--by restricting the very operations of the Net itself, and the devices that allow people to use the Net.</i> <br /> <br />As I said below, the war is not new; but maybe we have the possibility of an end in sight.

  <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2002/4/25/1345/03329">kuro5hin.org || Macaulay on Copyright</a> <br /> <br />Thomas Macaulay spoke successfully against the posthumous extension of copyright in the House of Commons in 1841: <br /><i>I believe, Sir, that I may with safety take it for granted that the effect of monopoly generally is to make articles scarce, to make them dear, and to make them bad. And I may with equal safety challenge my honourable friend to find out any distinction between copyright and other privileges of the same kind; any reason why a monopoly of books should produce an effect directly the reverse of that which was produced by the East India Company's monopoly of tea, or by Lord Essex's monopoly of sweet wines. Thus, then, stands the case. It is good that authors should be remunerated; and the least exceptionable way of remunerating them is by a monopoly. Yet monopoly is an evil. For the sake of the good we must submit to the evil; but the evil ought not to last a day longer than is necessary for the purpose of securing the good. <br />[...] <br />Just as the absurd acts which prohibited the sale of game were virtually repealed by the poacher, just as many absurd revenue acts have been virtually repealed by the smuggler, so will this law be virtually repealed by piratical booksellers. At present the holder of copyright has the public feeling on his side. Those who invade copyright are regarded as knaves who take the bread out of the mouths of deserving men. Everybody is well pleased to see them restrained by the law, and compelled to refund their ill-gotten gains. No tradesman of good repute will have anything to do with such disgraceful transactions. Pass this law: and that feeling is at an end. Men very different from the present race of piratical booksellers will soon infringe this intolerable monopoly. Great masses of capital will be constantly employed in the violation of the law. Every art will be employed to evade legal pursuit; and the whole nation will be in the plot. On which side indeed should the public sympathy be when the question is whether some book as popular as Robinson Crusoe, or the Pilgrim's Progress, shall be in every cottage, or whether it shall be confined to the libraries of the rich for the advantage of the great-grandson of a bookseller who, a hundred years before, drove a hard bargain for the copyright with the author when in great distress? </i> <br /> <br />This is a great find - a clear speech on the topic that shows that these isues are not new. <br /> <br /> <br />

  <a href="http://www.frankston.com/public/essays/FCCInContext.asp">Bob Frankston has an essay on how the FCC should change policy to replace 'telecoms' with 'connectivity'</a> <br /> <br /><i>The simplest ideas are often the hardest to explain. How do we explain that an entire industry is no longer necessary? It's as if we tried adapt an industry built around horses to supporting auto-mobiles. Fortunately the horse industry didn't have the regulatory support that keeps the telecommunications industry from evolving into a connectivity industry. <br /> <br />The good news is that connectivity is indeed simple and our task is to remove barriers rather than create a new and ever more complex regulatory system. The key problem is that the first mile of connectivity is an artificial chokepoint created by modeling telecommunications after the railroads and granting privileged rights of way to companies providing a specific service. There is an inherent conflict between this service-based model and connectivity which gives the customer the ability to define the services. <br /> <br />The remedy of structurally separating the companies that provide connectivity from those that provide services and content may seem radical but it is not unprecedented. We've seen movie studios being forced to divest themselves of their theaters and the TV networks, in turn, couldn't own the production companies until a competitive industry developed. <br />[...] <br />The biggest surprise was yet to come. As capacity grew it became possible to use the Internet for carrying audio and video streams without any special engineering. The early implementations were tricky because they had to work around the capacity limitations but the Moore's law effect delivered abundant capacity. Capacity involved not only bandwidth but also latency � for interactions with remote services the travel time was critical. <br /> <br />Just like specialized word processors could not match the rapid pace of improvement in general purpose computing, special purpose networks were no match for the general purpose networking that the Internet provided.</i> <br /> <br />Another good exposition of the central point - compare with the ones I collected <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_01_01_epeus_archive.html#9226867">here</a>.

Today, our nation faces domestic and foreign piracy of a different sort: the illegal duplication of software, music, DVDs, and other digitized information. This piracy comes with a high price. Last year U.S. copyright industries reported losses of nearly $22 billion due to piracy just from overseas. <br /> <br />Today, copyright owners are faced with the challenge of adapting to the digital revolution.

It is that uncomprehending fact of digital life that disturbs the sleep of the entire U.S. film industry.</i> <br /> <br />About 2/3 the speed of light in fibre; 1/3 in copper; speed of light in air. But when was miles per second a useful unit for a movie? I know they measure films in feet, but you can't send a mile of film per second. Anyway, when a film is projected it really does travel to the screen at the speed of light... <br /> <br />I'm not even sure how a fact can be uncomprehending. <br /> <br /><i>In testimony before the Judiciary and Commerce Committees I have outlined a number of specific goals relative to the development and adoption of technology standards by the Information Technology (IT), consumer electronics (CE) and copyright communities. These include the adoption of a "broadcast flag" to prevent unencrypted over-the-air digital television broadcasts from being redistributed on the Internet; adoption and implementation of technology to plug the "analog hole" whereby protected content is stripped of its protection through the digital to analog, or analog to digital, conversion process, and the adoption and implementation of technology to limit the rising tide of unauthorized peer-to-peer file distribution of copyrighted works, of which I have spoken. The attainment of these goals is key to the viability of a legitimate marketplace for the online digital distribution of motion pictures,</i> <br /> <br />Here is where he gets it badly wrong. As he has said that they want to distribute movies digitally, and they think 99% of users would pay a reasonable price, what justification is there to burden everyone else with the cost of developing these technical 'fixes'? Why not just prosecute the abusers under existing copyright laws, as he has outlined?

  <b>I can read people's thoughts.</b> <br /> <br />Using an ancient technology, handed down over millennia, improved and refined along the way, I am able to read people's thoughts. And not just people nearby, or people I know. I can even read dead people's thoughts. <br />This gives me a great deal of power and knowledge - I can learn from their lives, their experiences, their dreams and fears, their insights and imaginings. I can study their successes and failures, learn from their great ideas and their mistakes, absorb their experiences, laugh at their jokes and wince at their pain. <br /> <br />This may seem like a scary idea - you may feel nervous and want to avoid me, but don't worry. I can only read your thoughts if you want me to. You need to be part of this too. You need to write your thoughts for me to read them. <br /> <br />That's right.

  <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-883558.html">Google protects its search results </a> <br /><i>This month, about 100 Comcast subscribers were temporarily shut out of Google when the search company charged the high-speed Internet access provider with hosting some accounts that had abused its terms of service by performing "automated queries." The crackdown cut a wide swath, taking out a block of IP addresses, shutting down the guilty and innocent alike. <br /> <br />"We are not accusing you personally of having violated our Terms of Service," said Google's notice to Emoungu, a computer programmer who has been a subscriber to Comcast's high-speed Internet service for two years.

It shows many interesting emergent behaviours, and how you can resolve the iterated prisoners dilemma with a few good men and true. But can too much information be a bad thing? <br /> <br /><i> "There are plenty of different cities and countries that have gone from a high degree of corruption to a low degree of corruption," Hammond says. His A-society suggests that in such a transition, the fear of being caught may be at least as important as the odds of actually being caught. To test that possibility, Hammond re-ran his simulation, but this time he allowed all the agents to know not just how many of their friends were in jail but how many people were jailed throughout the whole society: in other words, the agents knew the odds of arrest as well as the police did. Sure enough, fully informed agents never got scared enough to reform. Hammond's A-society seemed to have "grown" a piece of knowledge that many law-enforcement agencies (think of the Internal Revenue Service, with its targeted, high-profile audits) have long intuited - namely, that limited resources are often more effectively spent on fearsome, and fearsomely unpredictable, high-profile sweeps than on uniform and thus easily second-guessed patterns of enforcement.</i> <br /> <br />

  <b>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</b> <br />I've been at the National Association of Broadcasters show in Las Vegas this week. Vegas doesn't suit me - call me an ascetic bookworm, but its plastic recreations of other places, suffused with the perpetual ding-ding-ding of slot machines does not attract me. <br /> <br />Reading <a href="http://www.nab.org/newsroom/pressrel/speeches/040802.htm">Edward. O. Fritts address </a> I found this passage not to my taste either: <br /><i>On the evening of the attack itself, 60 million Americans tuned in to broadcast TV. The American people tuned to us by a four-to-one margin over the major cable news networks combined. <br /> <br />Radio also played an important role -- and one-third of all people say that they are now listening to radio more than they did before September 11th. During those days of terrorism and trauma, you didn't hear the notion that broadcasting was no longer relevant. Our relevancy was obvious. And it was immediate. The horrible tragedy of September 11th pulled this often-divided nation together. And it did something else. It reaffirmed that broadcasting remains competitively relevant...technologically vibrant...and constant in its civic purpose. Indeed, this was our finest hour.</i> <br /> <br />He did attack the CARP rates: <br /><i>...we were extremely disappointed by the rate structure set by the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel with respect to radio streaming. It's puzzling to us why those who control the music industry want fees to be excessive to the point that many radio stations will be driven off the Web. We believe the CARP panel misinterpreted the intent of Congress and erroneously imposed high rates on broadcasting, and we're fighting to have the opinion voided. <br /> <br />In all of our battles, let's not forget that the services of broadcasters come free to the public. Few things are free anymore with the exception of the public library and over-the-air broadcasting...and we are going to fight to keep it free.</i> <br /> <br />So it seems he is in agreement wiht the <a href="http://rtnews.globetechnology.com/servlet/RTGAMArticleHTMLTemplate/C/20020410/gt?tf=tgam%252Frealtime%252Ffullstory_Tech.html&cf=globetechnology/tech-config-neutral&slug=gt&date=20020410&archive=RTGAM&site=Technology"> unanimous rejection of the CBDTPA</a> <br /> <br />Later Marc Andreessen was <A href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/3031836.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp">pointing out the truth</a> <br /><i>As film studios and recording studios urge Congress to extend copy protection to every home entertainment device, Andreessen said the entertainment industry need look no further than the software industry's own expensive, failed attempts at encryption to realize it is ineffective at stopping piracy. <br /> <br />``If a computer can see it, display it and play it -- it can copy it,'' said Andreessen, in a keynote address to the National Association of Broadcasters convention.</i> <br /> <br />Their response was not recorded. <br /> <br />I bumped into Bob Cringely, whose <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20020328.html">Open Source TV</a> idea sounds interesting. <br /> <br />I also managed to read Lessig's 'Future of Ideas' which ends with thoughtful suggestions on restoring a creative commons. <br />

  <span class="p-name">Edemame</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <b>Edemame</b> <br />The dominant cultural motif of the 20th century in America was standardisation of processes, attempting to achieve economies of scale, with a veneer of choice. <br /> <br />This came home to me most clearly when I was sequestered in a basement at Electronic Arts in San Mateo with Maf in 1994, completing the first version of 3D Atlas by working round the clock, with brief breaks for food and sleep. Having flown in from London, we were jet-lagged to start with, and there being 10 testers giving us bug reports to address, our anomie was amplified. <br /> <br />We would emerge at random intervals into the bright California sunlight, and try to find something to eat nearby, a task made harder by the implosion of nearby Fashion Island Mall into the ghost mall so accurately described by Coupland in Microserfs. <br /> <br />We would stagger into Rocking Robin, or Togos or whatever, and then be subjected to the standard fast food quiz by the Turing-test-failing waitroids: <br /> <br />-Howchallikeitdone? <br />-Ummm... medium <br />-Souporsalad? <br />-Salad please <br />-Whakinadressing? <br />-Olive Oil vinagrette <br />-'taliando? <br />-OK <br /> <br />This is the approach described by the phrase 'Just the way you want it'. <br /> <br />One day, tired and phased, I went through the wrong door into Togos, and somehow ended up in a newly opened Japanese restaurant. At 2.30pm, it was quiet, so I walked up to the sushi bar. The sushi chef bowed to me, said hello, and looked at me carefully. He said 'You need to eat this' and handed me something delicious and wonderful. He was absolutely right. I ate it, and he produced more delightful fishy foods, and served me tea. <br /> <br />One of the the things I ate there that day (and all subsequent lunchtimes while we were there) was Edemame. This simple dish consists of small green beans boiled in their shells, then sprinkled with salt and allowed to cool. You pop them out of the shell into your mouth, the salt on your fingers adding piquancy. <br /> <br />It wasn't until years later that I realised that this delightful dish was made from Soya beans. School dinners in England frequently featured sausages or burgers manufactured from soya protein by the food processing industry. They had somehow decided that what we really wanted was vaguely meat-like food products made out of these beans, with their flavour disguised by adding fat and pepper. The contrast between these fresh, healthy, tasty green vegetables and the slimy, tasteless, beige sausages was so great that they were in no way recognisable as the same thing. <br /> <br />Here on the web we can find the Edamame in the authentic voices of the people we meet, and shun the processed sausages of the content industry. <br />

  <span class="p-name">The CBDTPA Is Immune to (Conventional) Criticism</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  Now this a scary thought: <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.jerf.org/writings/CBDTPA.html">The CBDTPA Is Immune to (Conventional) Criticism</a> <i>And so it is with the CBDTPA. The details of enforcement are absurd. <br /> <br />The framers of the bill have some dim sense of this, and they have tried to address it. The CBDTPA includes a few clauses to the effect of "And enforcement of this law shall not be absurd." Imagine a law that says "It shall be illegal to posses the ability to jaywalk, but the rights of the people to move freely shall not be lessened." Well, simply saying that doesn't make it so. You can have the law enforced and absurd, or not enforced (in which case, let's leave it off the books.) Same for the CBDTPA; the law as written has some attempts to wave the absurdity away, but it just doesn't work. It is impossible to salvage the invalid form of the law, no matter how you gussy up the appearence, just as no matter how much you add to an argument based on affirming the consequent, you still have an absurd argument.</i> <br />

It's easy to kill spam in such a system, and since the spam warriors are about to kill the present system, it'll have to be ready for the refugees.</i> <br /> <br />I think he's right - we need to use digital signatures for ID, but we won't until Mail clients make this automatic.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.yil.com/columns/column.asp?columnist=ebert&date=020401&page=01">Roger Ebert</a> has noticed the foolishness of copy-protected CDs. He goes even further than I did when I corresponded with <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/?/2002_01_06_epeus_archive.html">Universal Records</a> about it in January. <br /> <br /><i>The late, unlamented DivX scheme represented the same idiotic marketing reasoning that the Universal Music Group has implemented. So did the Hollywood studios' original opposition to home video. We live in a time of buzz, when musical reputations are formed below the radar of the accountants of the music industry. The way to launch a new CD is to get it talked about�not to insult potential fans by making it unplayable on their equipment even after they buy it legitimately. <br /> <br />Peter Cohen reports that Universal plans to offer refunds to customers who buy a disc and find they cannot play it. He also observes, "Many retailers employ a no-return policy once the CD's wrapper is off." And wisely so, since it would be the easiest thing in the world to buy a disc, rip it to your computer through your stereo, post it on the Web, and then return the CD for a refund. Did I just say that?</i>

  Robert Redford's Oscar speech: <br /><i>We have a great industry and we all know that. We're here because we know it, we love it. It's a solid and healthy industry, but even though it is, I really believe it's going to be important in the years to come to make sure we embrace the risks as well as the sure things. To make sure the freedom of artistic expression is nurtured and kept alive. Because I believe that in keeping diversity alive, it will help keep our industry alive. <br />As we can see of late, the world around us is in a seachange. It is just simply not the same world anymore. As we all struggle to find our way with it, to get a grip, to make sense out of the chaos and the destruction and the tragedy, one word that emerges is the word "freedom." Its importance, its rarity and how fortunate we are to have it. To be able to be part of a freedom of expression that allows us as artists to tell our stories in our own way about the human condition, the complexities of life, the world around us, is a gift. And not one to be taken lightly. And I think the glory of art is that it cannot only survive change, it can lead it.</i> <br /> <br />I hope Valenti and Hollings were listening.

  Senator Hollings has introduced the<a href="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/cbdtpa/hollings.cbdtpa.release.032102.html">Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Act of 2002</a> <br />This is the one that will outlaw Turing machines (see below). <br /> <br />I could argue with every line, but I'll pick out a few: <br /><i>But any device that can legitimately play, copy, or electronically transmit one or more categories of media also can be misused for illegal copyright infringement, unless special protection technologies are incorporated into such a device. Unfortunately, as technology has advanced, copy protection schemes have not kept pace, fostering a set of consumer expectations that at times actually promote illegal activity on the Internet. For example, according to a Jupiter Media Matrix report, over 7 million Americans use technology on the Internet to swap music and other digital media files. More recent news reports place this number at over 11 million. While some of this activity is legal, much of it is not. </i> <br /> <br />You cannot prevent copies being made. Get used to it. You can't prevent people receiving broadcast TV signals either, but there seem to be some viable business models there. <br /> <br /><i>Every week a major magazine or newspaper reports on the thousands of illegal pirated works that are available for copying and redistribution online. Academy award winning motion pictures, platinum records, and Emmy award winning television shows � all for free, all illegal. Piracy is growing exponentially on college campuses and among tech savvy consumers. Such lawlessness contributes to the studios and record labels� reluctance to place their digital content on the Internet or over the airwaves. </i> <br /> <br />Another non sequiter. They could reduce their distribution costs by a couple of ordes of magnitude, but they refuse to. <br />Now for the lies: <br /><i>Although, it is technologically feasible to provide such a protected environment, the solution has not been forthcoming through voluntary private sector negotiations involving the industries with stakes in this matter.</i> <br /> <br />It is provably impossible to provide this kind of protection. <br /> <br /><i>Although marketplace negotiations have not provided such an assurance, a solution is at hand. Leaders in the consumer electronics, information technology, and content industries are some of America�s best and brightest. They can solve this problem. The consumer electronics and high tech industries claim they are ready to do just that. America�s top high-tech executives sent me a letter three weeks ago to that effect. While, I want to believe them, industry negotiations have been lagging. Both sides share some blame in this area. But the blame games need to end. Its time for results, not recriminations. </i> <br /> <br />Don't believe them. They are knaves and fools if they promise you the impossible. But you are a bigger fool to try and legislate for the impossible. <br /><i>Over the air broadcast digital signals cannot be encrypted because the millions of Americans who receive their signal via antennas cannot decrypt the signal. As a result, digital broadcast signals are delivered in unprotected format and are subject to illegal copying or redistribution over the Internet upon transmission. The technology exists today to solve this problem. It has been referred to as a "broadcast flag" which would instruct digital devices to prevent illegal copying and Internet retransmission of digital broadcast television. </i> <br />Compete nonsense. <br /><i>As protected digital programming (usually delivered over satellite or cable, but also available on the Internet) is decrypted for viewing by consumers on legacy analog devices � most frequently on television sets � the programming is temporarily "in the clear." At this point, pirates have the opportunity to take advantage of an "Analog hole" by copying the content into a digital format (i.e. re-digitizing it) and then illegally copying and/or retransmitting the content. The technology to solve this problem either exists today, or will be available shortly. Regardless, the solution is technologically feasible. As with the "broadcast flag" the solution to the "Analog hole" will require a government mandate to ensure its ubiquitous adoption across consumer devices.</i> <br />If it can be watched, it can be copied. This is clearly bogus. <br /><i>The final problem poses the greatest threat. Literally millions of digital files of music and videos are illegally copied, downloaded, and transmitted over the Internet on a regular basis. Current digital rights management solutions are insufficient to rectify this problem. Some consumers resorting to illegal behavior do so unknowingly. Many others do so willingly. Regardless, consumers desire high-quality digital content on the Internet, and it is not being provided in any widespread, legal fashion. Fortunately, a solution to this problem is also technologically feasible. It, too, will require government action, including a mandate to ensure its swift and universal adoption.</I> <br /> <br />It is not just technologically infeasible, it is mathematically impossible. <br />

  <span class="p-name">Google versus Indexers</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/bookreview.php3?table=old&section=current&issue=2002-03-16&id=876">In his review of Hazel Bell's 'Indexes and Indexers in Fact and Fiction', Andro Linklater says:</a> <br /> <br /><i>What must rank as today�s most useful index � covering 2,073,418,204 pages on the worldwide web and accessible through the Google search engine � is compiled entirely by computers. Google�s superiority over rivals like Hotbot is due to the capacity of its software to catalogue entries according to a crude hierarchy of relevance. But as this charming anthology illustrates, a good index amounts to far more than a catalogue. </i> <br /> <br />Andro misses Google's subtlety here. While it is compiled by computers, it is based on the links between web pages made by humans, who are doing exactly the kind of indexing he praises. <br />Google's relevance hierarchy is far from crude; it works on the assumption that pages that are linked to by many other pages are more useful, and it takes into account not only the words on the linked-to page, but the words within the links pointing to it. It then takes this idea one stage further, but giving greater weight to links from pages it has already found to be important. <br /> <br />This interesting mixture of democracy and elitism is what gives Google its remarkable ability to list the most useful pages first - it is harnessing the collective indexing decisions of all the people individually publishing web pages that link to each other. <br /> <br />I just searched for 'Andro Linklater indexers' and got no results, because no-one has linked to the article yet. I am going to link to it from my own webpage so that by the time the Spectator publishes this letter, readers will find that search succeeding.

  <a href="http://samizdata.blogspot.com/?/2002_03_10_samizdata_archive.html#75012566">Neel Krishnaswami</a> is taking a very centralised view of reputation that smells of a synoptic delusion to me. The real revolution in online reputation is happening from the ground up, with Google being the prime example. <br /> <br />Google ranks webpages on how many pages link to them. It then repeats this process, weighting the links from highly linked-to pages higher. In effect, some pages have a higher reputation than others through an emergent mechanism created by all those individual links. <br />One can argue whether this is elitist or democratic endlessly, but it is certainly based on a Hayekian spontaneous order. <br /> <br />For example, I posted <A HREF="http://www.ertnet.demon.co.uk/2kinds.html">Two Kinds of Order by John Marks</A> on March 11th, and mentioned this to some colleagues who might be interested. I linked to it from <A HREF="http://gonzoengaged.blogspot.com/">a Weblog</A> or <A HREF="http://epeus.blogspot.com/">two</A>, and <A HREF="http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/03/11#alongThoseSameLines">Doc Searls</A> did too.<BR>Today it is <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=two+kinds+of+order">number 1</A> on a search for 'two kinds of order' out of over 2 million, and a search for <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=John+Marks">John Marks</A> brings the page up in 5th position, despite there being lots of other John Marks's on the net. <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/03/08/cory_google.html">Cory</a> explains this in more detail, and how a centralised effort can never match this. <br />

  <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_03_01_archive.html#75007706">Dave</a> has been musing on whether the web is spatial or not. I'm not sure that the web itself is, but the tools that we use to experience it use primarily spatial notions. They didn't call them 'Navigator' and 'Explorer' by accident, they were expensive branding exercises (both carried out by the same company, whose name still escapes me). Mosaic, the original Browser's name, is much closer to the 'small pieces loosely joined' idea. <br /> <br />Google and Blogdex and Daypop are beginning to find other ways to think about them. <br /> <br />The most literal spatial view of the web was Apple's long forgotten <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:product.info.apple.com/pr/press.releases/1996/q4/960903.pr.rel.projectx.html">Project X</a> which displayed sites and the links between them in a 3D space you flew through. It didn't really work, because the dimensions didn't mean anything. <br /> <br />I remember back when I was building CD-ROM UI with Maf, Nikki and Chris, the number of times we fought aginst the plodding page at a time model that was put together largely because it could be laid out as a storyboard or slide presentation, but broke down as soon as you tried to build it. We always took the view that you should be able to get to anywhere from anywhere, and built products on that basis. <br /> <br />The most successful of these was 3D Atlas, which despite selling over 2 million copies has almost vanished from the web. The best I can find is <a href="http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/school/html/reviews/atlas.htm">this review</a> and this old <a href="ftp://ftp.gamesdomain.com/pub/kidstuff/pc/cwonders/Atlas.EXE">Windows demo</a>, plus the fact it was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/advocacy/internet/mena/morocco.htm">banned in Morocco</a>. <br /> This really was a spatial interface, using the earth as its space. As you zoomed in, you could find countries and be presented with spatially relevant suggestions. I always wanted to make this a UI for the web, but the various companies involved fell apart in the CD-ROM market collapse of 1996-7, and I did other things instead. <br /> <br />Still, it did nudge Graham into creating the great website that is <a href="http://flags.net">flags.net</a> which, being a labour of love, has outlasted all the companies involved in publishing 3D Atlas. And to think it all started with the innocent question 'Graham, could you make us some flag icons for the lists...' <br />

  <span class="p-name">An open letter to Jack Valenti and Michael Eisner</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  <p>Jack, in your <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62085-2002Feb24.html">sneering Washington Post piece</a> about copy protection, you refer to professors for whom ‘"innovation" is legalizing the breaking of protection codes’. Michael, in your <a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/hearings/hearings.htm">testimony to congress</a> you badgered an Intel exec until he told you that file copying can't be prevented, then told him he must prevent it anyway. <p>As you are evidently impervious to logical discussion, let me tell you a story. <p>This is the story of a rebel, a war hero, a persecuted homosexual, and a deep thinker. His life reads like the plot of a far-fetched movie, but if anyone fits your bogeyman image of professors who break code, it is Alan Turing. <p>In 1936 Turing published a paper on theoretical mathematics, in which he described the Universal Turing machine. It was a simple mechanism that could read symbols from a tape, and write back different symbols or change the tape's direction. He showed that with this general purpose machine, you could simulate any special purpose computing machine. He had invented the idea of the programmable computer. <p>Between 1938 and 1945, Turing worked in great secrecy on computing machines that broke codes. These were the first real computers ever made, and the codes they broke were those used by the German Wehrmacht. Without his work, it is very likely that Britain would have lost the War in Europe before Pearl Harbour. <p>After the war, in 1950 Turing published other famous papers that laid the foundation for modern computing, and hence all the digital gadgetry that you would like to outlaw for us (though presumably you'd keep the computers you use to edit and create effects for your movies). Turing died in 1954 by biting into an apple he had previously poisoned. <p>What does this story have to do with you? <p>Turing's Universal Machine means that you cannot have a software or hardware protection scheme that is secure. Whatever scheme you come up with can be simulated by another computer. The computer industry are not opposing your bill because they want to encourage copying, or because they are bloody-minded, they are not opposing you because of your self serving rhetoric about rewarding artists (remember Peggy Lee, Michael?), they are opposing you because what you want is provably impossible. You can only succeed by making all Turing machines illegal. <p>If Alan Turing had made an animated film involving a poisoned apple in 1936, it would still have copyright protection. He chose a different path, and gave the world the idea of the digital computer. I know whom I respect more.

  Michale Greene was surprisingly candid in his <a href="http://grammy.aol.com/features/speech.html">Grammy Speech</a> <br /><i>That very special connection between the fan and the artist is an historically important partnership, one which enriches and entertains the public, motivating and sustaining the creator.

The consolidation separates the artists from producers and promoters who know and care about them. The Internet disconnects the record companies from being in between the artist and the fan. No wonder he's worried. Look at that Rip,Mix,Burn ad again - artists and fan, talking one on one.

  Jack Valenti, MPAA CEO, has written a rude and thought-free <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62085-2002Feb24.html">article</a> <br />He takes a hard Tinseltown line gainst the professors (the 'nutty' is implied) who beseige the movie industry. <br /> <br /><i>The reason pitifully few films are legitimately available on the Internet is not producer hoarding.</i> <br />Oh really? Why is Disney running TV ads about <a href="http://www.dvdexpress.com/product_movies.asp?type=movie&productnumber=7322">Snow White going back in the vault</a> then? <br /><i> It is that those valuable creative works can't be adequately protected from theft. The analog format (videocassettes) and the digital format (DVDs) are different. Videocassette piracy costs the movie industry worldwide more than $3.5 billion, even though the sixth or seventh copy of analog becomes unwatchable. But the thousandth copy of digital is as pure as the original. Moreover, digital movies on the Internet can be pilfered and hurled at the speed of light to any spot on the planet. This is what gives movie producers so many Maalox moments.</i> <br /> <br />This is true. But DVDs are out there and making lots of money, despite their copyability. The restricted version of DVDs, DIVX, with a player that would phone the MPAA to find if you were allowed to play it today, died an unmourned death 3 years ago. <br />It's a simple proposition, Jack. A market works two ways. Set the price too high, and no-one buys. Adding restrictions to your DVDs makes them less valuable to purchasers, not more. I explained this to Universal about CDs, and it is just as true for Movies. <br /> <br /><i>What's keeping the movie industry from making its creativity theft-proof? Simply put, in order to transport movies as agreed to by the consumer on a rent, buy or pay-per-view basis with heightened security, computers and video devices must be prepared to react to instructions embedded in the film. Other ingredients are necessary to protect digital content, but it gets too complex to explain in a few sentences. At this moment, that kind of interaction is nowhere to be found in any computer or set-top box. Some security is available, but it is porous. The movie industry is, however, consulting with the finest brains in the digital world to try to find the answer.</i> <br /> <br />This is false. It cannot be made theft-proof, without outlawing computers. Ask <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0105.html#3">Bruce Schneier</a>, who wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471117099/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">the book on encryption</a>: <br /> <br /><i>All entertainment media on the Internet (like everything else on the Internet) is just bits: ones and zeros. Bits are inherently copyable, easily and repeatedly. If you have a digital file -- text, music, video, or whatever -- you can make as many copies of that file as you want, do whatever you want with the copies. This is a natural law of the digital world, and makes copying on the Internet different from copying Rolex watches or Louis Vuitton luggage. <br /> <br />What the entertainment industry is trying to do is to use technology to contradict that natural law. They want a practical way to make copying hard enough to save their existing business. But they are doomed to fail.</i> <br /> <br />The problem with Hollywood is that they love a good story, a good pitch. The snake-oil salesmen who claim that this is possible are telling them just what they want to hear, and in Hollywood the truth can never get in the way of a good story. Truly smart thinkers like Schneier and Lessig are ignored, in the great Hollywood tradition of the outsider who defeats conventional wisdom, and is free in one bound. <br /> <br />Here's Jack again: <br /><i>As for the third charge -- that copyrighted movies are destroying digital innovation -- what the critics mean by "innovation" is legalizing the breaking of protection codes, without which there is no protection.</i> <br /> <br />This is ad hominem slander. If Valenti read Schneier and Lessig, he would see that they are trying hard to help the industry develop models that can work with publicly-visible content. They do exist after all, in broadcast television. <br /> <br />Schneier's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471253111/ref=ase_epeusepigone-20">book 'Secrets and Lies'</a> discusses the issues of how to design an entire system that is not vulnerable to code being cracked. <br /> <br /><i>Movie producers are eager to populate the Net with movies in a consumer-friendly format. There is a way to achieve adequate security for high-value movies on the Net. Computer and video-device companies need to sit at the table with the movie industry. Together, in good-faith talks, they must agree on the ingredients for creating strong protection for copyrighted films and then swiftly implement that agreement to make it an Internet reality. </i> <br /> <br />This protection racket isn't going to happen. The computer industry is not going to indemnify the Movie backers against the inevitable copying. Which brings us to the next item in the master plan (at this point Valenti switches roles, and gets out a white cat and a swivel chair) <br /> <br /><i> Without concord, one option is left: Congress must step in to protect valuable creative works on the Net and thereby benefit consumers by giving them another choice for movie viewing.</i> <br /> <br />This is the tail wagging the dog. The computer and communications industry generates far more revenue and value than the entertainment one. Ask <a href="http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_2/odlyzko/">Andrew Odlyzko</a>. But then, he is a professor, who argues from logic, not a professional manipulator of emotions... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

  Lessig has written a <a href="http://spectator.org/AmericanSpectatorArticles/Lessig/Control.htm">well reasoned article, </a> which mentions the <A HREF="http://a772.g.akamai.net/5/772/51/3435fc99fd3a89/1a1a1aaa2198c627970773d80669d84574a8d80d3cb12453c02589f25382e353c32f94c326950366cb3db1/itunes_concert-long-sref.mov">Rip, Mix, Burn ad</a> that I thought was a very strong expression of fair use, but he misses the Church-Turing hypothesis. This is a win for his battle against arcane restrictions on computers to protect content - by emulating the client computer that is allowed to play the content back, the Turing machine defeats the hegemony he fears. It also counters his argument that in 50 years time no computer will be able to run current software. For an encouraging example, he need only look at MAME, the Multi-Arcade Machine Emulator, that will run any videogame from the last 24 years. <br /> <br />A suggested modification to his copyright terms. Twenty years free registration. A dollar for the 21st year. Double this every year thereafter. This would allow Disney to keep paying to keep Mickey out of the public domain, but instead of backroom deals with legislators, it would cost it more and more in copyright fees to do so. To get to 50 years would cost $2<sup>30</sup>, or about $500 Million; to get to 55 years it would be $17 billion. Most works would drop out sooner, but the blockbusters could keep paying for exclusive rights.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  <P>TV engineers' problem is locking a picture to another picture to allow them to be cut without glitches. This requires timing video signal one to another very accurately. If the signals are not timed within a vertical frame, you see a roll on a cut.This requires an accuracy of one vertical line, about 1 part in 600. To prevent a horizontal shift on a cut, you need a lot finer accuracy, about 1 part in 250,000. Doing this with valve technology in the 40s was impressive work, but it did require devoting over a third of the video bandwidth to synchronisation pulses. <p>To prevent a colour shift in composite video, you need to preserve colour phase, which means you need to be locked to a fraction of the 4.3 MHz colour signal. To do this, every playback device in the professional broadcast world is locked to 'station sync' which is driven from a very tightly-locked crystal signal. <p>When I worked at the BBC, I saw the Rubidium clock at TV Centre that drove the station sync pulse generator, and hence every camera and video tape machine in the building, and on out to the microwave towers and transmission masts, and through the ether to the millions of TV sets across the British Isles, all of their electron guns sweeping across the phosphor dots together as one, beating in time with this central heartbeat. <p>How could they give up all that order for the chaos of the net?

  Thanks to <A HREF="http://www.aldaily.com/">Arts & Letters Daily</A>, a couple of pieces that may throw some oblique light on <a href="http://hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_02_01_archive.html#9814216">Weinberger et al's</a> lengthy meditations on how ones personality is expressed and even formed though public writings. <br /> <br /><A href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/14/technology/circuits/14LOST.html?pagewanted=print">Constance Rosenblum</a> lost all her email: <br /><i>But I was still baffled by the intensity of the psychological aftershocks, and even more than I wanted my old messages, I wanted someone to bring clarity to my feelings. Sherry Turkle turned out to be that person. <br />[...] <br />"People experience the computer as an extension of the self," Dr. Turkle pointed out. "It's an intimate machine, a mind machine. In a sense, you are your computer. <br /> <br />"We experience the data in the computer as durable, almost tangible. But when you lose your data, as you did, you realize that it is no more than where a bit, an electron, is sitting for a moment in time. And as a result of the loss, your own sense of fragility is enhanced." <br /></i> <br /> <br />Yet, Constance felt a sense of release at the loss, unfettered from others' chain letters, like Milosz. <br /> <br /><A href="http://www.thenewrepublic.com/011402/nagel011402_print.html">Thomas Nagel</a> writes on Nietszche , charting his struggle to disentangle and clarify the opposing Apollonian and Dionysian voices in his head. He needed to free his <a href="http://www.rageboy.com/0.57.html">inner RageBoy</a>. <br /><i>To take oneself and one's world as given, and move forward intellectually and practically from that starting point, was in his view a betrayal of the extraordinary freedom that we possess as reflective beings. Nietzsche recognized that, like all human beings, he had reached consciousness with a sense of himself and a system of values that was produced by a tangled human history together with biological sources of which he was largely unaware. To take real possession of himself, to discover who he was and to decide who he wanted to be, required a bringing-to-consciousness of everything that lay beneath and behind the socially developed and educated human being--the constructed individual who handles the world with concepts, values, and methods of thought whose sources and true meanings he does not understand. It required a radical self-transformation. <br />[...]plunging beneath your own inner surface through both psychological and historical investigation is essential. But knowledge is not the main point. The point is to achieve a different kind of existence: to live one's life in the full complexity of what one is, which is something much darker, more contradictory, more of a maelstrom of impulses and passions, of cruelty, ecstasy, and madness, than is apparent to the civilized being who glides on the surface and fits smoothly into the world. Because we are not animals, we are in a position to take conscious possession of ourselves in this way; but because we are socialized human beings, we tend instead to accept the superficial identities and the orderly system of beliefs that civilization has assigned to us. </i> <br /> <br />Perhaps. <br /> <br />For myself, I found an interesting echo of Marcus Aurelius in the advice I was given by a company lawyer after the Microsoft trial revealed the venal, vulgar and violent voices routinely used by that company's executives in internal email. <br /> <br /><i>Never say anything in email you wouldn't want you mother to read on the front page of the newspaper.</i> <br /> <br />I cherish the ambiguity there. Truly a rule to live by. <br /> <br />

  An article <a href="http://www.techreview.com/articles/innovation10302.asp">proclaims the death of DRM</a>, but then goes on to offer hope that "some extremely bright people working in this space who will be able to figure out what the consumer is willing to put up with".<br /><br />This misses the point. Value is established by what people are willing to pay. Making them put up with something is going to exact a cost.<br /><br /> By hampering their works with restrictions on copying, they are reducing their value to those they expect to purchase them. DRM schemes are value destruction mechanisms, as <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2002_01_06_epeus_archive.html#8616468">I pointed out to Universal</a>.<br /><br />What they should be thinking about is how to add value for their purchasers. In Universal's case, the answer is to adopt the <a href="http://www.musicfan.com/ecd/">Enhanced CD</a> format (adding extra material for computer users) that is ubiquitous on CDs sold in the UK.<br /><br />

I want to be able to form opinion. By controlling the pipe, you can eventually get control of the content."</i> <br /> <br />Powell should be considering how to enable maximum flexibility by separating the commodity business of transferring packets from the open applications that define what the packets mean. This is how to maximise the value of the net for everyone, not for a few local monopolists - a fine job for a regulator.

  I try to avoid reflexive blogging about blogging, but I was trying to explain the significance of blogs to Stuart at lunch and this struck me afterwards. <br />The thing that makes blogs different from email is citation. I can paste URLs into email, but they are cumbersome, and launch the browser. With a tool like <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> you can read something on the web, add a comment and link to it in your blog straightaway. It is much easier than putting it in an email, especially for the reader, and it keeps a permanant record for you (or others) online. Once you get into it, you find that you read other people's blogs, and comment on them, and link to them as well. One interesting thing is that these make them very Google-friendly, so that increasingly if you search for a hot topic, a blog will have made it to the top because of these mutually-reinforcing links. (eg <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=trustworthy+computing">searching for 'trustworthy computing'</a> gives you <a href="http://paulboutin.weblogger.com/stories/storyReader$155">someone's blog</a>). It is fulfilling the original concept of hyperlinked text on the web. <br /> <br />A blog is also great place to keep your �sprit d'escalier bon mots while waiting for an occasion to reuse them. <br />

  Every year, Beloit College in Wisconsin <a href="http://www.beloit.edu/~pubaff/mindset/ <br />">issues a list</a> to help staff understand the mindset of students. I received a slightly edited version of the first 1998 list (class of 2002) by email, which was as follows: <br /> <br />1.Students starting college this fall were born in 1980. <br />2.They have no meaningful recollection of the Reagan era. <br />3.They were prepubescent when the Persian Gulf war was waged. <br />4.Black Monday 1987 is as significant to them as the Great Depression. <br />5.There has only been one Pope. <br />6.They were 11 when the Soviet Union broke apart, and do not remember the Cold War. <br />7.They have never feared a nuclear war. <br />8.They're too young to remember the space shuttle Challenger blowing up. <br />9.Their lifetime has always included AIDS. <br />10.They never had a Polio shot, and likely, do not know what it is. <br />11.The expression "you sound like a broken record" means nothing to them. <br />12.The compact disc was introduced when they were 1 year old. <br />13.They likely have never played Pac Man, and have never heard of Pong. <br />14.Star Wars looks very fake to them, and the special effects are pathetic. <br />15.Blue M&M's are not new. <br />16.They have always had an answering machine. <br />17.Most have never seen a black & white TV. <br />18.They have always had cable. <br />19.They cannot fathom not having a remote control. <br />20.Roller-skating has always meant inline for them. <br />21.The Tonight Show has always been with Jay Leno. <br />22.Popcorn has always been cooked in the microwave. <br />23.The Vietnam War is as ancient history to them as World War I and World War II, or even the Civil War. <br />24.Kansas, Boston, Chicago, America, and Alabama are places, not musical groups. <br /> <br />My son was born in 1995, which would make him class of 2017, I suppose. I wrote a list for him in 1998, and I think it is holding up well so far: <br /> <br />1.Students starting college this fall were born in 1995. <br />2.They have no meaningful recollection of Queen Elizabeth II. <br />3.They were toddlers when the Balkan war was waged. <br />4.The net stock crash of 1999 is as insignificant to them as the 1973 Oil Shock. <br />5.There has only been one Dalai Lama. <br />6.They were 9 when the EU broke apart, and do not remember Europe at peace. <br />7.They have never feared AIDS. <br />8.They're too young to remember Concorde. <br />9.Their lifetime has always included Computer viruses. <br />10.Wearing spectacles as anything other than dressing up makes as much sense as wearing bowler hats to work every day. <br />11.The expression "CD Quality Audio" means nothing to them. <br />12.The iMac was introduced when they were 3 years old. <br />13.They likely have never played Quake, and have never heard of Tomb Raider. <br />14.Titanic looks very fake to them, and the special effects are pathetic. <br />15.Blue skin tinting is not new. <br />16.IP addresses and telephone numbers seem equally arcane to them. <br />17.They don't understand the distinctions their parents make between computers, televisions, radios and newspapers. <br />18.Most have never seen a postage stamp. <br />19.They cannot fathom everyone watching the News at 10 - it is as odd as the concept of newsreels. <br />20.Commuting to work daily by car for 2 hours is as alien as accounting using paper and ink. <br />21.Any notion of scarcity of memory, processor speed, storage or bandwidth is on a par with 12 pennies to a shilling. <br />22.Chips have always been cooked in the microwave. <br />23.The Gulf War is as ancient history to them as World War II. <br />24.Cranberries, Fish, Cookies, and Meatloaf are foodstuffs, not musical groups. <br />25.Owning physical media to play music from it has to be explained to them very carefully, but they still don't get it. <br />

  I wrote to Universal's new address asking why they were going to stop making CDs I could play on my Mac. Here's the response I got, annotated: <br /> <br />On Wednesday, January 9, 2002, at 12:51 PM, MusicHelpOnline.com Support wrote: <br /> <br /><i>Thank you for your feedback regarding copy protected CDs. We <br />appreciate your opinion, as the consumer experience with the music we all <br />love has always been a priority at the Universal Music Group. <br /></i> <br />I don't 'consume' music. I listen to it. It's still there afterwards (though I get the impression that you'd like it if it wasn't). <br /> <br /><i>Unfortunately, over the last few years, the music industry has been faced <br />with a growing problem of unauthorized CD "ripping" leading to illegal <br />Internet distribution of music - a practice that is hurting everyone from <br />recording artists to songwriters to record stores. This illegal copying is <br />taking place on a massive scale, with literally millions of copies being <br />made without any compensation to the creators of the music. <br /></i> <br />Interesting progression of words here. The ripping is 'unauthorised'. Who needs to authorise it? Some ripped files have been illegally distributed, I'll grant you that, but then you say that 'copying' is illegal. <br /> <br />Under the Audio Home Recording Act, ripping and copying are not illegal at all; they are expressly permitted. You are confounding the legal acts of copying and ripping with the illegal one of distributing your copyright content without your permission. You are applying technology to attempt to prevent the former, instead of legal prosecution to prevent the latter. This is your mistake. <br /> <br />Your second mistake is take the word of someone that they can stop CDs from being copied. If someone can play your CD, they can redigitise the output, and rip that, and distribute it online. Its not worth my time and effort to fiddle around to rip the CDs in this way, so I won't buy them, but I'm sure the illegal distributors will work this out. <br /> <br />Net result: you have a lot of fed up former customers, and your music is still distributed online without your permission. Fewer people pay to listen to it, you get less money, and the illegal distribution goes on unchecked. <br /> <br /><i>If a way is not found to protect the music from these abuses, recording artists, <br />songwriters and many others will be deprived of their livelihoods. The <br />changing economics could cause fewer new artists to get a chance to find <br />their audience. <br /></i> <br />The music is not being abused. It is being listened to. It doesn't need protection. <br />Or do you mean 'protection' in the sense of 'protection racket'? <br /> <br />Courtney Love wrote a very well-reasoned <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/06/14/love/print.html">essay</a> on who is abusing whom in the record industry. <br /> <br /><i>Universal Music Group is committed to protecting the rights of our artists, <br />songwriters, and copyright holders, and, like the rest of the entertainment <br />industry, is evaluating emerging technologies to assess their viability while <br />also attempting to maximize the consumer experience. In addition, <br />Universal is exploring new ways to make music available in a variety of <br />online formats. We are also working with technology companies on new <br />offline formats that appeal to consumers. <br /></i> <br />Uh huh. Let me explain again. I have an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod">iPod</a>. (125,000 other people do too, and its only been on sale two months). It lets me carry around about 120 CDs worth of music at a time, in a package about the size of one CD box. I like this. I'm listening to more music than I was before because of it, and I will continue to buy CDs to rip and put into my iPod. If that isn't an offline format that appeals to consumers, I don't know what is. <br /> <br />However, you are explicitly working to stop me doing this. When I buy CDs at the moment, I look at the artists name, not the record label. Now I'll need to check that its not a Universal CD, in case you have 'protected' me from listening to it. This is one way of building awareness of the Universal brand, but probably not a useful one. <br /> <br /><i>We have licensed copy protection technologies developed by others and <br />are experimenting with the integration of those technologies into some of <br />our CDs as a first step in measuring their effectiveness in an evolving <br />marketplace. While the CDs with copy protection may not be playable in a <br />limited number of CD players, UMG is currently working with our <br />technology providers to achieve 100% playability. We also hope to <br />include Macintosh-based playability on copy-protected discs in the future. <br />We have not finalized our plans for 2002 nor have we made a commitment <br />to put copy protection on all of our CD releases. <br /></i> <br />You hope. I'm supposed to buy your CDs on the basis of a hope that you can kludge something together? Let me make it clear. I want Red Book Audio CDs, the gold standard for Audio Quality. I don't want CDs that break this spec, with an extra data track that includes some ghastly software player with a clickthrough licence you have bought from some software snake-oil salesman. <br /> <br />I have some very nice software to play CDs, thanks. It also helps me organise my collection, and move it to my iPod. I don't want to run your software. <br />I trust that these corrupt, Red Book violating CDs will be clearly labelled as such, so I can tell not to buy them? Otherwise, I'll just have to avoid all Universal CDs until you commit to shipping Red Book ones again. <br /> <br /><i>UMG has also established www.musichelponline.com to provide <br />consumers with support and to answer any questions you may have <br />concerning copy protected CDs. <br /> <br />We appreciate your business, and your support for the musicians who <br />bring so much to all of our lives. </i> <br /> <br />You evidently don't appreciate my business, as you have gone out of your way to stop me playing your CDs. I'm sure your support for musicians is just as sincere. <br />

  Dave Coursey is having <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/anchordesk/stories/story/0,10738,2836842,00.html">a snit</a> because Apple briefed Time and not him about the new iMac. <br /> <br />Such a snit that he then gets a lot of product details wrong, asking for a wireless keyboard and a second CD-ROM drive, then denying the existence of all the ports that would let him plug in such devices. Odd. <br /> <br />Time for some Truth, David - people are more interested in the machine itself than the details of who got to see it before release. Trolling to stir up pageviews of your column is what this is about, as this comment reveals: <br /> <br /><i> AnchorDesk's readership, for example, is predictably below average on days when Apple appears in the headline, which is consistent with the company's overall market share. </i> <br /> <br />

  Just watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005U8EM/epeusepigone-20">Groundhog Day</a> again on TV - what a great film. It takes on <a href="http://www.wpunj.edu/cohss/philosophy/courses/livedead/RETURN.HTM">Nietzsche's theory of eternal return,</a> which holds out the pessimistic prospect of your life repeating identically for all eternity, and then gives it a twist to say <i>carpe diem!</i><br> <br />Another book that takes on the same theme and attacks it from a very different perspective is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/034543076X/epeusepigone-20">Manifold Time</a> by Stephen Baxter, which both confirms and rebuts Nietzsche's view with quantum mechanics.

The new terms the music biz is trying to impose go further than preventing you sharing music with friends, by making it hard or impossible to copy or play the music yourself. Defending the right to copy music for friends is harder than defending my right to play it myself on more than one device, in the order I want.

  In the name of Digital Rights Management, corporations prevent you from editing or saving stuff they have published to you. This is odd, and at at odds with the spirit of Copyright. <br />No-one can tell you how much of their book to read, or the order you can read it in. Why do they presume to do so with sound or video? Why must I look at a green FBI notice for 15 seconds at the start of a DVD? <br /> <br />It is the act of re-publishing where the potential copyright violation occurs, not the act of viewing or editing. <br /> <br />Reject uneditable content and say why. Rights are for people, not digits or management.

  <A href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/11/10#lb6dfc398694f7b70d44d26bde292f696">Winer</a> and <a href="http://www.rageboy.com/2001_11_04_blogger-archive.html#7022398">Locke</a> are having a spat about memes, and the 'meme' meme. Those of us who actually read about evolution rather than using it as a trope, realise the Richard Dawkins invented the term in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192860925/epeusepigone-20">The Selfish Gene</a>, and returned to the meme theme in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192880519/epeusepigone-20">The Extended Phenotype</a>. In the latter he describes:<br /><blockquote>... a completely non-genetic type of replicator, which flourishes only in the environment provided by complex, communicating brains. I called it the 'meme'.[...]<br />"I was insufficiently clear about the distinction between the meme itself as replicator on the one hand and its 'phenotypic effects' or 'meme products' on the other. A meme should be regarded as a unit of information residing in a brain.[...]<br />"The phenotypic effects of a meme may be in the form of words, music, visual images, styles of clothes, facial or hand gestures, skills such as opening milk bottles in tits, or panning wheat in Japanese macaques.[...]</blockquote><br /><br />Dawkins later quotes correspondence between Wallace and Darwin, wherein Wallace suggests that Spencer's term 'survival of the fittest' is clearer and less question-begging than Darwin's 'Natural Selection'. Darwin liked this new phenotypic expression for his meme, but he said:<br /><blockquote>the term Natural Selection has now been so largely used abroad and at home that I doubt whether it could be given up, and with all its faults I should be sorry to see the attempt made. Whether it will be rejected must now depend on the 'survival of the fittest'...</blockquote><br />Dawkins parenthetically notes "Darwin clearly understood the meme principle".<br /><br />I can sympathise or at least empathise with Winer though. Too often the best storyteller for a particular audience can win out over someone who is constrained to telling the truth. A current example is the DRM debacle. Any competent engineer knows that the notion of locking up content from those who purchase it and view it on their own computers is technically impossible (setting aside the moral bankruptcy for a minute). The 'content owners' so much want this to be true that they are creating a market for snake-oil that appears to give them what they dream of. Which I suppose is poetic justice of a sort.

Samuel Johnson said of his Dictionary, "[I] do not form, but register the language," <br />>and it has always seemed to me rash for lexicographers to imagine they could improve on his program. <br /> <br />You have just inspired me to read Johnson's <a href="http://newark.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/preface.html">preface</a> to <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0742640868/epeusepigone-20">his Dictionary</A>, and I notice that he also said: <br /> <br /> "...every language has likewise its improprieties and absurdities, which it is the duty of the lexicographer to correct or proscribe." <br />[...] <br />"Much less ought our written language to comply with the corruptions of oral utterance, or copy that which every variation of time or place makes different from itself, and imitate those changes, which will again be changed, while imitation is employed in observing them." <br />[...] <br />"Language is only the instrument of science, and words are but the signs of ideas: I wish, however, that the instrument might be less apt to decay, and that signs might be permanent, like the things which they denote." <br />[...] <br />"Our language, for almost a century, has, by the concurrence of many causes, been gradually departing from its original Teutonick character, and deviating towards a Gallick structure and phraseology, from which it ought to be our endeavour to recal it, by making our ancient volumes the ground-work of stile, admitting among the additions of later times, only such as may supply real deficiencies, such as are readily adopted by the genius of our tongue, and incorporate easily with our native idioms." <br />[...] <br />"...the licence or negligence with which many words have been hitherto used, has made our stile capricious and indeterminate; when the different combinations of the same word are exhibited together, the preference is readily given to propriety, and I have often endeavoured to direct the choice." <br /> <br />Now we get to the bit you elide: <br /> <br />"Some senses however there are, which, though not the same, are yet so nearly allied, that they are often confounded. Most men think indistinctly, and therefore cannot speak with exactness; and consequently some examples might be indifferently put to either signification: this uncertainty is not to be imputed to me, who do not form, but register the language; who do not teach men how they should think, but relate how they have hitherto expressed their thoughts. <br /> <br />The imperfect sense of some examples I lamented, but could not remedy, and hope they will be compensated by innumerable passages selected with propriety, and preserved with exactness; some shining with sparks of imagination, and some replete with treasures of wisdom." <br /> <br /> <br />And a little further on: <br /> <br />"Nor are all words which are not found in the vocabulary, to be lamented as omissions. Of the laborious and mercantile part of the people, the diction is in a great measure casual and mutable; many of their terms are formed for some temporary or local convenience, and though current at certain times and places, are in others utterly unknown. This fugitive cant, which is always in a state of increase or decay, cannot be regarded as any part of the durable materials of a language, and therefore must be suffered to perish with other things unworthy of preservation." <br />[...] <br /> <br />A long passage on how languages decay, followed by this exhortation: <br /> <br />"If the changes that we fear be thus irresistible, what remains but to acquiesce with silence, as in the other insurmountable distresses of humanity? it remains that we retard what we cannot repel, that we palliate what we cannot cure. Life may be lengthened by care, though death cannot be ultimately defeated: tongues, like governments, have a natural tendency to degeneration; we have long preserved our constitution, let us make some struggles for our language." <br /> <br />You were right; I don't think you could improve on this programme. Please re-read it in full, and follow it closely.

What I'd add is that the moral aspects in <I>Doctor Who</I>, <I>Stardust</I> or even <I>Harry Potter</I> are pleasant and acceptable because they aren't (totally) simplistic. Take the Doctor -- he has a clear moral compass, but his actions often can't help bring destruction to innocents close to his path. Sometimes he backtracks on his choices -- and sometimes people are dying because his initial actions. And emotionally, he is ever so slightly an alien, wired differently and ultimately unable to fit fully into human psychology. (It's also one of the reasons <I>Torchwood</I> is such a mess: it's not nearly got a moral substructure as well-constructed as DW.) <BR/><BR/>(I'm not so sure about that <I>Dangerous Book for Boys</I>, even though I haven't read it, because for all its merit it seems to reinforce gender stereotypes in an unfortunate manner. Maybe I'm wrong but I can't see many girls picking it up.)

  I agree that H.264 video support in Flash would enable the easy creation of a HUGE amount of flash video players to emerge, which could play both formats (FLV and H.264).<BR/><BR/>FLV support in the forthcoming Flash Lite 3.0 for mobiles will be interesting, but I'm sure many people will argue that many smartphones already come with H.264 support (many with recording too).<BR/><BR/>Maybe if QuickTime fixed/updated their crappy support for Flash tracks and also rejuvented their SMIL suppport - RealPlayer is still the best SMIL player (imho: having built a SMIL publishing system years ago)<BR/><BR/>SMIL enable(d/s) us to orchestrate text, audio, images, flash and video using a simple XML format. <BR/><BR/>The potential for this was HUGE. Now we only see SMIL (Basic) in sych things as Picture text messaging to create 'cute' slideshows.<BR/><BR/>Good SMIL support with up to date Flash track support by Quicktime would be their best move.<BR/><BR/>It's win-win. :)<BR/><BR/>Kosso<BR/>twitter.com/kosso

  I dunno.<BR/><BR/>Botnets, by definition, are parasitic infections on legitimate users' machines; in many jurisdictions they're illegal. (And where they're not illegal, they should be!)<BR/><BR/>What customers would be crazy enough to trust massive quantities of their data to something so fragile, in legal terms?<BR/><BR/>Spammers nowadays can store all their important data on Command-and-Control servers, off the botnet entirely; as botnet nodes are shut down, killed off, or filtered, it doesn't affect the *data* in any way-- just the output volume. That's proven to be a key part of the botnet design, as far as I can tell, and I think there's a good reason for it.<BR/><BR/>BTW, in the past we have seen spammers attempting to justify a semi-legal spam-proxying app as instead being a form of distributed computation software -- ie. something their users installed through their own free will. However, it became clear they were talking bullshit -- in fact their software was just plain old malware, iirc, and the users hadn't opted in at all.

  Hi Dave Winer here..<BR/><BR/>A blog can be like a word processing document. Creating one is just about as easy as File/New. So why shouldn't you create a document for an event even for a thought or a list of things to do.<BR/><BR/>We started down the wrong path when we started thinking that blogs were like magazines or newspapers. I don't want to be on the same leaderboard as TechCrunch and CNET or the NY Times. That's like putting my shopping list on the same page as the list of stocks in S&P 500 or DJ. Apples and oranges.

  I have always had a disconnect with the concept of viral. Things that go viral are a stunning experience, but they rarely have sustainable value. Often, they fall as fast as they climbed.<BR/><BR/>Organic growth is so solid, so much less gaming, less pressure. So for me, a much better fit. The people who watch our show, really love it and tell their friends. It's too "deep" and on the surface, "too shallow" to get in a minute or so, so that precludes a fast laugh that tends to signify a lot of viral video.<BR/><BR/>I appreciate the post!

  Twitter as a public is heady. It's very easy to get lost in there and stay there. Despite Michael Arrington calling it a prank/stunt, I think I understand why @gapingvoid walked away, and then came back. I think that makes great sense. <BR/><BR/>Further, Twitter has become, to me, a public in that almost Roman sense of the word. It's a forum of minds and thoughts. It's a place to formulate and extrapolate. It's a place where there are value exchanges. <BR/><BR/>So I very much see your point and raise it.

  This is pretty much exactly what we've done with iPages on top of OpenSocial... With one twist...<BR/><BR/>Our implementation is based on the belief that most pieces of data have natural 'authoritative' sources and that the data should be consumed from that source. So our OpenSocial container has a data abstraction behind it (xdi) instead of a data store. <BR/><BR/>Data portability in as much as authoritative sources only need to provide access to a single 'highly trusted' third party.<BR/><BR/>Virtual data hosting in as much as the functionality is brought to the data for delivery of useful services.<BR/><BR/>More on my <A HREF="http://xditao.blogspot.com" REL="nofollow">blog</A> .

  I love metaphors, but I can't stand by when they get muddled. A virus is nothing like Cancer.<BR/><BR/>Virus reproduce themselves by infecting a host, infiltrating the host's cells with their own DNA, to generate copies, and then the reproduced 'phages' are passed from one host to another via appropriate vectors. (e.g. sneezing).<BR/><BR/>Cancer is when the individual's *own* cells go into 'runaway' (endless regenerative loops). All the cells in a cancerous tumour have the same DNA as the healthy cells of the same individual.<BR/><BR/>So... all very well to criticise the idea of 'viral marketing', but don't use the metaphor of 'cancer' to make the point, or you'll simply make the wrong point.<BR/><BR/>P.S. Kevin, I know it was something you overheard, rather than something you came up with yourself. Just being pedantic.

  Nice summation of a long thread of Net history. This role was also dubbed "host" on the Well, whose management understood its importance early on. (Derek wrote a whole book on this topic!)<BR/><BR/>Flickr's founders, <BR/>Caterina and Stewart, took on this task in the early days of Flickr. It's so important to *any* attempt to build Web community/conversation that their approach -- don't hire someone to fill the "host" slot, but rather show your first-adopter users that they have a direct relationship with the folks in charge -- may well be the best, in the earliest stages at least, before it scales unmanageably... And of course assuming that your founders are in fact adroit at their hostly roles.

  Great post Kevin.<BR/><BR/>This is a role women have played for many years, sometimes seen as Salon hosts (like Gertude Stein) most often uncredited. <BR/><BR/>Ah yes, what to call it?<BR/>I've been calling my live version of it interactive comedy, DJing people and interactive performance as well as "theatre as commons." But that's coming from a performance rather than business point of view. <BR/><BR/>More on how it works here:<BR/><BR/>http://subvert.com/media/interactive%20performance2.cwk.pdf<BR/><BR/>In a business context I've also used the phrase Open Source Management<BR/><BR/>more here (which includes a conversation with Flickr conversatriss George Oates)<BR/><BR/>http://subvert.com/blog/opensourcemanagement/<BR/><BR/>"Creating the space" is everything. This is a place where artists and performers have a great deal to teach the business world.<BR/><BR/>It is an odd mix of being "in charge" but serving the conversation rather than yourself..thus often leading to names and titles that don't sound "important" in traditional business realms. You make an important point here.<BR/><BR/>For me, I have a lot that comes with doing a "show" or treating a business meeting as one that helps escape this issue a bit.<BR/><BR/>The people who wish the be at "the top" of an organization need to reorient themselves to the centre of a conversation they need to serve. Scott makes a solid point about Stewart and Caterina's priorities making all the difference.

  What about "salonnière" from the 16th century intellectual French Salons?<BR/><BR/>Very much the same role and it is not as dry and lifeless as moderator and facilitator.

  A community 'owned' by a charismatic leader can also thrive, for example the Whitechapel forum of Warren Ellis.<BR/><BR/>He's not really a moderator, but it seems that everyone respects the space out of fear of displeasing him.

  We've been trying to come up with a suitable title for this role at Osmosoft, where the project we're working with is open source. Obviously 'Manager' isn't appropriate in this context. In the end we settled for 'Community Advocate', partly because it's an inward facing role (where we help other people in BT understand how the community dynamics works). But it's not perfect!

  Hi! What an interesting blog! I should say that financial companies at the present time, may be very dangerous. The thing is that a large proportion of such institutions are a fraud. They are established to get money from the clients and then suddenly disappear or go bankrupt. They trick in people by offering high interest rates on the deposit accounts. It is better to give your money to a trusted company, like <A HREF="http://wells-fargo.pissedconsumer.com" REL="nofollow">Wells Fargo</A>, for example. Browse this great site www.pissedconsumer.com for customers’ reports about the company.

  I second that: avoid Wells Fargo. <BR/><BR/>In our case we were approved for a VA loan at 100%. However, the underwriter isn't satisfied and demands things we cannot provide; one of them a new power of attorney so that I can handle things while my husband is in Iraq. *Nevermind* he's been given one alrady and it was fine *before* we finished up his conditions for the 2nd time. Not to mention that most of the drama is from an error on the application that *they* put down. The bank has been stringing us along for so long that my daughter no longer lives with me and I'm at a friend's house quite homeless. It shouldn't matter that our credit scores aren't the best. Approved (not pre-approved) is approved. And a bank error on their part is not something I should have lost my family over.

  I couldn&#39;t agree with you more Kevin. I spent a lot of time wibbling on about the stats from Technorati&#39;s State of Blogosphere report which show more blogs than ever, show blogs becoming more influential than ever and people updating more frequently. Twitter&#39;s figures are dwarfed in comparsion - however - ironically I saw your post through Twitter and not an RSS feed. <BR/><BR/>People just have many more ways to do &quot;traditional&quot; blogging now. As you imply people do micro blogging through Twitter, or image blogging through Flickr &amp; friend blogging through Facebook. It&#39;s also a case of sharing thoughts &amp; experiences &amp; it&#39;s bound to &quot;water down&quot; the posts coming from &quot;old school&quot; bloggers &amp; make them appear as though they&#39;re going off blogging.<BR/><BR/>I have a single topic blog and occasionally it veers off topic - but love Twitter for the freedom of sharing anything that happens to be on my mind. And being able to just randomly thought dump which I don&#39;t feel I can do in my blog (mainly cos my reader expect me to write about the Tube).<BR/><BR/>Thanks for stating what I&#39;ve been thinking about for a while!

  Well put, Kevin. You said it far better than I could have. Blogging is about conversation, largely unmediated conversation, between passionate amateurs. As the number of ways to blog increases, and as the number of places to blog increases, the concept of the historical ranking becomes less meaningful.<BR/><BR/>Like you, I continue to use Technorati, but not for its ranking. I want to know who's entered the conversation. My conversation. Your conversation. Any conversation I'm interested in.

  Kevin-totally agree with you, and I'm deeply ambivalent about using emails as OpenIDs. On the one hand, it's undeniable that, at least today, and at least for the adult population, knowledge and comfort of email addresses vastly exceeds that of URLs, especially when it comes to signing into services. On the other hand, URLs make much better identifiers for all the reasons you mention, and surely the web is still "young" in terms of the right long-term infrastructure, esp. for identity. I think the trick will be for us to find a way to use the email-crutch to make OpenID more mainstream more rapidly, without selling out on its fundamental value in the process. Oh, and BTW it's "Internet Identity Workshop", not "Internet Identity World", but either way, glad you'll be able to make it! ;)

  Who says they're carbon neutral? They do. But there is no standard for carbon neutrality. <BR/><BR/>For example, Dell says it is carbon-neutral, yet according to the WSJ's recent story, what Dell covers in their stance is only 5% of what they really produce.<BR/><BR/>Saying Google is carbon-neutral, thus invalidating the Time story, is uninformed, at best, and ludicrous, at worst.

  Julien, you have a point, but you're not breathing in Oxygen while holding your breath, so I think it balances out mostly.<BR/><BR/>Renata - do follow that link and read about all the things Google is doing to reduce energy use and fund renewable energy. If you're going to complain about computers' energy use, Google is a long way down the list.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  I think there's a vast difference between the carbon emitted by breathing and that used in power generation or for materials manufacturing. Breathing is generally carbon neutral since the dominant source of carbon in your body is things you've eaten, so you're recycling free carbon over a period of years. By contrast, power generation using fossil fuels is converting sequestered carbon in coal and oil into additional free carbon in the atmosphere.

  "Cuban is conveying the last gasp of the self-important TV broadcast mentality that dreams of intoning "here we are, live to the nation", and all we can do is listen."<BR/><BR/>Exactly.<BR/><BR/>It's worse here in Dallas, where Cuban's properties are pervasive, concentrated. Billboards and local TV commercials "command" you to passively consume Cuban owned sports, HD satellite, etc.<BR/><BR/>We'll be seeing more and more of these death rattles from the dinosaurs this year as the economy takes it toll on Old Media.

  I love how your narrative used mannerisms of interaction between child and adult that haven't been seen since Charles Dickens ("please miss..."). Seriously, though ...everyone with money in broadcasting is scrambling to find the next big thing, which they can't get a handle on. The media outlets are being forced to follow in an area where they have led for ever.

  Being the producers of a "main stream" national television series in our 10th season (www.HippyGourmet.com), we find ourselves living between two worlds: Traditional broadcasting and time shifted internet audiences.<BR/>The first offers us access to a wide group of people who equate seeing our series and brand on PBS and syndicated TV with 'validity.' The second offers us a world of opportunities to share full-length episodes and/or segments across many social network platforms and to leverage our vast library of content in a way traditional broadcasting just can't do (as yet). <BR/>We predict a marriage between the 1950's style television ad models (never cutting for commercial by keeping all the product placements and promos internal to the show), and the power of todays social networking.<BR/>As for live? The jury's still out on the best types of content and events people will be drawn to in the moment.

  I think perhaps the most amusing thing is Alain de Botton's claim that "They don’t say, 'What do you think of Descartes’s second treatise?' on Twitter" - as it happens to be Descartes' birthday today, and he's been mentioned/quoted 15 times in the last hour on Twitter. <BR/><BR/>Meanwhile the father of modern philosophy rates four words in the "Anniversaries" column of the Times Online: "René* Descartes, philosopher, 1596" - and only seven mentions all this year.<BR/><BR/><A HREF="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Descartes" REL="nofollow">http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Descartes</A><BR/><BR/>vs. <BR/><BR/><A HREF="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sitesearch.do?x=41&y=8&query=Descartes" REL="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sitesearch.do?x=41&amp;y=8&amp;query=Descartes</A><BR/><BR/>Top story on Sunday Times right now is:<BR/>"I had sex with my brother but I don't feel guilty"<BR/><BR/>Top topic on Twitter now is #insight - a discussion of a political debate programme that has just aired on SBS TV in Australia (our second public broadcaster) on the topic of internet censorship.

  So on a little more research of course it turns out that there IS no "Descartes' Second Treatise", which would be why people aren't twittering about it.

  Very nice indeed. Maybe it's just because I'm slow, but I've never before thought of an aggregation service as an authentic investigative reporting service of meta-news.<br /><br /><br />"Extra!

  I love this Kevin..why do you think I call myself a " Cloud Hostess " ? It is about creating a beautiful environment, inviting the right people to create a dialogue and then supporting the conversation in a safe way. I was raised to be a corporate wife with the skills to enable a partner amd myself to build relationships for business and social. I see this now happening in a digital salon and it is very exciting and should be even more so to advertisers who can track and interact their brand in a more interactive and emotional way.

  I have some of these in my garden they clump together and look like a piece of moss and then every now and then they all separate and then clump back together. Does anyone know what they are?

  Excellent post. It is telling that there isn't a good English word for this role. I like Simon Cast's salonniere suggestion, but I wish even more that there was a human manifestation of the native talking stick<br />http://tinyurl.com/99y5rl because of the universal understanding of the sacredness of listening and advancing the conversation for all to benefit.

  Potential issue:<br />My social net is mostly composed of developers, and thus most faces look like (old) white guys. It's getting hard to distinguish between all of them. It'd be easier if the field had a bit more a diverse face spectrum. :)

  I&#39;m expecting so much more from Google on the Social Networking side of things. I am very dissapointed with Facebook and Twitter doing all the popular moves on that side of things. But without you at Google, who is going to make sure Wave and Android becomes the best Social Networking platforms ever made and really change the way the web is used for the better.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  Hi Kevin,<br />I think the fake friends/ social objects theory is right up to a point. But it doesn&#39;t account for the tremendous time people put into celebrity worship, or the raising up of celebs and then the attempts to associate yourself with the celeb. For many the time sink can vastly outweigh the time put into the rest of one&#39;s real social experience.<br /><br />It&#39;s one thing to have a celeb as a social object we can all discuss, it&#39;s another to stretch it to &quot;i&#39;m associated with them,&quot; to be obsessed with the fame and the nearness one might have (autographs, sightings, objects produced by the celeb, even actions taken at their direction like the Demi/Ashton donation efforts which use this energy of the masses for good, etc.)<br /><br />I think the social object idea only goes so far in explaining how much time and effort people put into this stuff, and how strongly they need to lift up and self associate with that which is lifted up in fame. <br /><br />I think humans are, in immature form, prone to put things up above us, or down below, and organized religion used to give structure to that tendency, no matter how immature it is. As we get older, grow a bit, we realize that superficial things aren&#39;t bigger or higher than our own selves, and things we disliked for silly reasons aren&#39;t beneath us. There is balance, the world has shades of grey, and personal connection is most real and important in our social experience.<br /><br />The question i still have is why people need to be near the famous, why they want to be famous themselves, when it&#39;s all so false? Why can&#39;t they see that falseness? And why would they want to put themselves further into a false realm when it&#39;s going away from that world that would bring them deeper connections and experience?<br /><br />Currently my only answer is that fear maintains a stronger hold than the healthiness of real connection and therefore the need to have a celeb be counted as a social counterpart, to be worshiped, to be held up, keeps people from having to see the deeper reality of their lives. And as Doc says, it&#39;s a lovely distraction from reality that has terribly unproductive consequences.<br /><br />Mary

  Good stuff from both of you. <br /><br />I would add that the choice to associate with celebrity, or a more formal association, such as a ball club, has the generally harmless effect of giving one membership in something. I now, for example, belong to &quot;Red Sox Nation,&quot; as they call it in Boston. These may also be examples of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granfalloon" rel="nofollow">granfalloons</a>, which Kurt Vonnegut defined as &quot;proud and meaningless associations of human beings.&quot;

  Hi,<br /><br />I know this post is from a long time ago but I am starting to become some kind of madman because of the problem I encounter with jah.<br /><br />Here is the thing, I implemented it in a webpage (rather complicated one) en modified it a bit. When I tested the thing, it just didn&#39;t work (jah error: Unknown).<br /><br />I tried tons of thing and finally just took the codes from you exemple and guess what ? Not working, even with the same sources as you have (it&#39;s working on your link but not my website, I just don&#39;t understand).<br /><br />Can you just contact me at mazziotta.p.f@gmail.com if you have a little idea ? <br /><br />Thanks in advance.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  We were in a bus yesterday to a bunch of pretty teenage girls and their adult chaperone, who had just arrived by plane in Los Angeles from George, presumably to do tourist things in the city. When we mentioned that more than a million people applied for tickets to Michael Jackson&#39;s funeral, they all said they wished they had applied too. &quot;It&#39;s so sad,&quot; one of them said.<br /><br />I think what we&#39;re dealing with here is fandom. People are loyal to individual celebrities the same way they&#39;re loyal to sports clubs and favorite players. Some of this comes from genuine appreciation for the unique values those individuals bring to the world. I feel that way myself about many individuals, in technology, business, sports and other fields.<br /><br />But obsession with celebrity for its own sake, which was the subject of my blog post, is a different thing. I believe a lot of that has to do with a kind of half-minded churn. Covers of supermarket tabloids now treat the Obamas as celebrities. Barack has secret meetings with Muslims, one says. Michelle has an enemies list, another says.<br /><br />This is a popular form of spam. It&#39;s a scam and a come-on. But some people, lots of them, take it seriously. Or seriously enough. My case is, Yeah, but it&#39;s still a waste of time and energy. It is, as Shakespeare put it, &quot;full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.&quot; I also believe that, since nothing does less than something -- and since there are more somethings to do than ever, thanks to the Net (and each other), the nothing-doings of the world will have ever less leverage.

  I am enjoying this thread v. much.<br /><br />As such, it seemed a McLuhan-esque/Marxist angle could be fun here. Aren&#39;t celebrities simply commodities? They offer us direction, something to consume, as well as the ability to fly far beyond our immediate contexts. Of course, we need to remember our Icarus-like desires and not fly too close to the sun, right?<br /><br />Lisa Belkin wrote yesterday in the NYT magazine: &quot;Talking about others is our way to test the social boundaries — to learn what raises eyebrows, what is met by shrugs — without directly talking about ourselves.&quot; In this sense celebrities and celebrity gossip allows us to establish cultural norms. We can talk, compare notes, in the comfort of our homes, and hopefully lean something in the process without directly commenting on our own personal conditions and addictions.<br /><br />Perhaps, though, we might benefit from talking more about our selves than others, which, am told, Twitter supports pretty handily.<br /><br />Thank you again for offering this conversation.

  In what sense would can a digital purchase be returned? A &#39;used&#39; item has a depreciated value, a new and a used digital book are identical.

  I&#39;m very seriously considering foregoing the iPhone app for my own company, and instead focusing on full web compatibility. Any app produced could be done the Google method, just using the webkit API methods to pull from the web so you get the App Store juice. What Google has done with Latitude and the other HTML 5 tie-ins has been very impressive!

  Again and again I hear of applications being blocked from the App Store for stupid, often commercial reasons. If consumers apparantly accept Apple’s blatant censorship of the App Store, why would they not accept blatant blocking of web applications on the iPhone?<br /><br />I don’t really understand how consumers let them get away with this and keep pouring the praise on the iPhone and Apple. If Microsoft would do such things there would be hell to pay. And as nice as the iPhone seems, I for sure won’t be getting one. I’d rather have an open (Java based) platform.

  I agree wholeheartedly - when the iPhone came out I was very excited by its web options because it meant that a phone could be used for the same purposes my PC could, and that anything I&#39;d use on the web on my PC would be usable on the phone.<br /><br />Unfortunately because of Apple&#39;s desire to hold the market and stiffle competition they&#39;ve blown the App thing out of proportion, and its become yet another platform that developers have to work to support, both with pages specifically designed for the iPhone at the expense of other phone browsers, and with Apps that are tied 100% to the device.<br /><br />The idea that we could have this utopia of platform independence with the internet is still there, but when companies are more concerned with making sure their product sells more than other products, and will resort to castrating Apps for their own device in an attempt to do this its hard to see how we can make progress.

  The heart of the matter is that the Internet wants to be open. By that I mean we (for the most part) want this to happen to spur innovation. Any hardware providers that attempt to blockade the nature of the beast make themselves prime targets for ridicule and to be run over by the need for open efficiency.<br />I feel a little bad for Apple but am happy I&#39;ll be able to make wireless phone calls via google voice and skype soon :)<br /><br />So how can I best nuke the OS on my phone and use a different provider, Android for iPhone?

  I prefer the &quot;Sushi Boat&quot; web. When you sit down, dozens of fresh - if unfamiliar - sushi selections flow by you. <br /><br />It&#39;s best that you don&#39;t eat everything that comes by you. <br /><br />Instead, sample a few things, and if you find something you like, get more.

  I love the flow past web and description. But, having now spent a lot of time on the other end of the adoption curve working on culture change and adoption - the big objection I hear is the fear of information overload - and it is a huge barrier to adoption. <br /><br />But then again, perhaps by the time the flow past web reaches mass adoption - those who complain of information overload - maybe their brains will have evolved or they&#39;ll be retired.

  Well, the flow past web could be a kind of &#39;asymmetric&#39; real-time. <br /><br />The test could be that if it the flow past web, activity streams etc were symmetric would they match your definition of real-time from voice world, i.e. low latency. :)

  PHSB into Superfeedr into Notifixious is great ;) Got that in less than 1 minute!<br /><br />I think the biggest difference between Twitter and say, facebook, is that Twitter is roganized in a &quot;timely&quot; manner, while Facebook is geographically organized. With Facebook, you can see &quot;where&quot; people in your network, not much (event though more and more) what is their &quot;present&quot;. While on twitter I can barely identify the people I follow (where did I meet them? When? Through who? Who are they? even, are unanswered questions. However, I know about what they do now.<br /><br />I think Twitter and FB are just 2 dimensions of the same thing.

  I&#39;ve started to become quite resentful of the &quot;twitter police&quot; telling me what, who and how I&#39;m to post on twitter.<br /><br />In fact, I took action and blocked a bunch of people who were more &quot;professional associates&quot; of a sort, then blocked my feed from public view.<br /><br />The point is, as you say, I really do find it interesting what Simone had for lunch. <br /><br />And my friends are interested in what I&#39;m listening to on iTunes.<br /><br />Everyone else, well, if they asked to follow me, they hardly have room to complain.<br /><br />Too much ado about too little.

  &quot;The key to Twitter is that it is phatic - full of social gestures that are like apes grooming each other.&quot;<br /><br />You said it, not me.<br /><br />I got much grief for my column about<br /><br /><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/may/07/twitter-is-a-suckers-game" rel="nofollow">&quot;Twitter: sucker&#39;s game that boosts elite&quot;</a><br /><br />But your post here is a paean to what I view as negative. When you say &quot;it means you can follow authors or film stars without drowning them in friend requests, and get the same phatic sense of connection with them that you get from friends.&quot;, that&#39;s exactly the manipulation of celebrity I don&#39;t want to take part in. Celebrities are NOT your friends, and simulating that feeling to sell a sense of connection to both sides is an old cynical business.

  Great post! The &quot;face&quot; question is something I have been pondering for a while as well. I find that the &quot;feeling&quot; of the avatar often mingles with the quality of voice and subtly affects how I interpret the post or tweet (adding friendliness, or irony, eg). I also find that the avatar increases my ability to remember a tweet by engaging multiple areas of the brain so that I can re-visualize a tweet or a FB post, in effect, as a hieroglyph or a mini-billboard.

  I feel like facebook and twitter has a slight similarity-both &quot;updated status, what are you doing?&quot; And with FB when someone post a comment on your status or wall that&#39;s the &quot;@reply&quot; with twitter. <br />I can honestly say twitter and facebook are VERY addictive!

  I love this description of Twitter. It&#39;s a great grasp of what it is and what it means. I&#39;ll be adding this to my list of viewpoints I point people to when they ask me &quot;what is Twitter&quot; and I answer &quot;Here is what it means to me [description], and here is what it means to others [links]&quot;<br /><br /> And you are right - Laura does a great job revealing the emotion and connection driving Twitter as well as the business use in her Google talk.<br /><br />(and thanks for the nod for Twitter For Dummies - the three of us had such fun writing it)

  I agree, that&#39;s a fascinating point about the faces &amp; about how we develop connections that way. I&#39;ve seen people in my Twitterstream get ferociously upset when other people change their avatar. Even a slight change, and I&#39;ve seen some folks get REALLY miffed -- as if the other person is now gone or you&#39;ve fundamentally altered your personality to the point that it&#39;s now difficult to maintain the same kind of connection you had before. I&#39;ve seen this happen more than once, and you&#39;re left with the choice of forcing your way through it until people &quot;recognize&quot; you again, or just changing your photo back.<br /><br />It also explains this: people I know who disparage Twitter but DO use email quite often don&#39;t understand why anyone cares what so-and-so is up to. I had the same idea when I first began to use Twitter, but now I can sincerely say I DO care what my friends (many of whom I&#39;ve never met in real life) &quot;eat for breakfast,&quot; to use the stereotypical let&#39;s-slam-Twitter example. Being involved w/ the mundane details of their lives &amp; seeing them day after day develops that personal connection in a way that email can&#39;t.

  A couple of points I think are also important:<br />Twitter Followers aren&#39;t Friends. People put far more meaning in being a &quot;friend&quot; than just following what they say.<br /><br />Unfollowing is painless. Get tired of someone going on and on about something you don&#39;t care about? Unfollow them. They won&#39;t be told so there is no drama over unfollowing like there is over un-friending.

  Kevin, <br /><br />You reference Habermas -- that&#39;s awesome! i came across a theory of triple contingency in social media, the idea basically that the &quot;public&quot; in social media is a &quot;third&quot; contingency. An audience not addressed by the twitter but whose &quot;presence&quot; is sensed, and which would contribute to the user sensing him/herself being seen. This would be nice to develop using perhaps Sartre, or mimetic desire, or some other mediated sociality theory... <br /><br />I think this aspect of conversational media perhaps the least understood -- as an openly structured social medium, the presence and attention economy of the &quot;invisible public&quot; (danah boyd) is largely imagined. As soon as another user pays direct attention to you in twitter, or indirect (retweets or @name mentions), it&#39;s communication -- a relation has been established. In absence of that sign of attention, however, the &quot;public&quot; is an &quot;at large,&quot; and how this motivates, incentivizes, appeals to users we don&#39;t well know. That it does -- that some level of interest in being seen, being visible, contributes to the medium is virtually certain. For social media do recapitulate mass media -- as a form of communication they do *also* reproduce, in their own way, a version of mass media, and thus some of mass media&#39;s social and cultural characteristics (from news production to celebrity and fame).<br /><br />I&#39;ve done a bit of speculating around the psychological dimensions of mediated interactions specific to twitter. These posts touch on those: the variety of ways in which people with different social competencies, communication styles, and personalities may experience twitter. <br /><br />Apropos theory, I think Luhmann&#39;s social systems theory is a very compelling resource for social media theories -- tho he and habermas were in acute theroetical disagreement.<br /><br />http://www.gravity7.com/blog/media/2009/06/twitter-etiquette-reading-between-lines.html<br />http://www.gravity7.com/blog/media/2009/06/reading-tweets-its-complicated.html<br />http://www.gravity7.com/blog/media/2009/06/if-you-think-twitter-is-weird-youre-not.html

  Julien, P_LOCA I do think these theories apply to Facebook and other interactions too.<br /><br />Seth, we always seem to have a glass half full, glass half empty conversation around this. Compared to previous models of interaction, this provides a way for the famous to talk to individuals and be drawn in, not repelled. Sounds like I should write more on this point.<br /><br />Leslie, I didn&#39;t mean to miss out you and Michael as co-authors - Twitter for Dummies is a great book on Twitter; but I have spent more time talking to Laura.<br /><br />Catherine, Dan, I think the faces are really important, though I do wonder if always having the same icon works - if you could pick which facial expression accompanied a message, would that convey more? <br /><br />Adrian, thanks for the links; I&#39;ll read them today

  <div class="e-content">
  
  &quot;Making following asymmetric is similarly freeing for social relationships&quot;<br />Yes, but there is more here than just asymmetry... The really important attribute is who holds asymmetric power -- who decides what messages will be received.<br /><br />Traditional messaging systems implement asymmetric &quot;<b>sender-controlled</b>&quot; messaging. In an email or postal system, the sender decides who will receive his messages and he can typically send to anyone whose address he knows. <br /><br />Microblogging systems excel by implementing asymmetric &quot;<b>receiver-controlled</b>&quot; messaging. In such a system, a sender can publish as many messages as he wishes, however, none will be read unless some reader subscribes to those messages.<br /><br />This decoupling of sender and receiver (or publisher and subscriber) is what distinguishes Publish/Subscribe or PubSub systems from traditional &quot;messaging&quot; systems. <br /><br />Microblogging systems also typically implement &quot;sender-controlled&quot; messaging via direct-messages to compliment their &quot;receiver-controlled&quot; PubSub messaging which is implemented by &quot;following.&quot; Both patterns are necessary in a &quot;complete&quot; communication system. One reason we&#39;re seeing microblogging become as popular is that it is providing a more complete messaging system than traditionally available.<br /><br />For a really complete messaging system, you need:<br />Senders should be able to:<br /> * Determine who receives messages<br /> * Publish messages that others can subscribe to.<br /> * Restrict potential subscribers via mechanisms like ACLs (Access Control Lists) which filter based on attributes of the receivers.<br /><br />Receivers should be able to:<br /> * Determine who can send them messages<br /> * Filter messages received based on attributes of sender and/or message content<br /><br />Most, but not all, of the above has been implemented by microblogging systems. Of course, this will all eventually devolve into open protocols and simply become part of an integrated, distributed messaging system.<br /><br />bob wyman

  Hard to add to such a great post, but I&#39;ll try. Jeff Atwood described Twitter as public IM in a 2007 post entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000840.html" rel="nofollow">When in Doubt, Make It Public</a>&quot;. To me, the essence of Twitter is that it not only enables public conversation, but makes broadcasting the default, letting receivers decide how to filter. The filtering could be more sophisticated, but it&#39;s good enough--and simple to understand.

  Great article on Twitter! I love the analogy of apes grooming themselves in a grandly public forum. It&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re reaching out for, that broad scale contact with people who share our interests. <br /><br />In that sense, Twitter has a hugely underrated potential as a powerful tool. No wonder so many find it addictive!<br /><br />I think it&#39;s the next step in our evolution, in a nutshell. Naturally, there is more to our evolution than a techno-tool, but it seems to be spear-heading the direction we are most likely to grow.<br /><br />Thanks for the thoughts!<br />Donna Carrick<br />http://blogdc.donnacarrick.com/

  Kevin, you wrote: &quot;This is analogous to the pre-web hypertext systems that insisted every link would be bidirectional, thereby preventing the power-law distributed link structure that builds a small-world network to connect the web and provides the basis for Pagerank. Being able to link to something without it having to give you permission by linking back is what enabled the web to grow.&quot;<br /><br />The bidirectional hypertext system I know about was called Xanadu. Xu links had distinguished ends, but every link could be followed from either end. The link lived outside of the linked-to page and emphatically did <i>not</i> require the permission of the linked-to page&#39;s owner. A main goal was to support criticism links that could be followed backwards from the criticized piece (say an ad) to the criticism, including filtering by who wrote the criticism. What specific system(s) had the properties you mention? <br /><br />Also, regardless of the particular form of bidirectional links, I&#39;m curious why you feel they would prevent pagerank.

  Thanks for this, I have realy struggled to understand Twitter and why anyone would take time to follow people let alone update information, but your thoughts have really tweaked interest for me. I run a team building company and see a real opportunity for us to incorporate this technology into our adventures and you have clearly defined the premise upon which it would make sense.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Lynn<br />http://www.conundrumadventures.com

  I am not so sure any of you are right about twitter. Some of us know the power it has right.....but how many people really know how tou use it? I don&#39;t claim to be an expert but I have a technique or two like most do to use twitter like a dirty little secret.<br /><br />I made some accounts right before googles last update. to be exact 6 weeks or 39 days before the update and would you believe they came out page rank 5s and 6s with little work that I actually automated. Then I linked them to a fresh web site and pushed that site to number 3 on a very saturated market.<br /><br />Now why is twitter so compelling? so addictive on so many levels? because we want to understand it and used it up until we find our next fix.<br /><br />Good luck yo you all on finding what you are looking for. Right now all I am looking for is some sleep.

  Quote: <i>Google attempts to show the &#39;most important&#39; comments first. .....</i><br />I am assuming that &quot;<i>most important</i>&quot; will eventually be a balance of &quot;rated comments&quot; (public policing), and at some point &quot;people rank&quot; will also tie into things.<br /><br />Google uses a &quot;social algorithm&quot; to determine who your <i>friends</i> are, which provides &quot;social rank data&quot; hopefully combined with data from other sources (e.g. Twitter etc).<br />Once things get &quot;noisy&quot; it would obviously be useful to be able to filter by &quot;connection&quot; as well as &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;people rank&quot;

  First I thought the concept of twitter could be revolutionary. Then it struck me that it is just another way of reading or keeping up with streamed thoughts from a pool. Similar to friendfeed, facebook status updates, socialmedian etc. except that twitter allows you to look up and follow people whom you would not otherwise come to know. I.e., it allows cross access, anybody can access anybody profile page. That is not possible with friendfeed/facebook etc.

  I love your thoughts about buffering and realtime.<br /><br />I have grown so accustomed to BBC iPlayer, podcasts and x264 downloads that I got rid of my TV a year or two back. TV is only good for live events such as sport or terror attacks.<br /><br />It has come to the point were live streams such as the Gillmor Gang really annoy me because I can&#39;t pause them and nip to the loo. :)

  Great discussion here, thank you - my question is more over-arching - it seems to me that twitter would a really useful platform for finding people who are interested in the same TOPIC (not just friends, or celebrity so-called friends). But you can&#39;t search by topic, or subject.<br />Three questions arise<br />a) am I right<br />b) could it be changed<br />c) wouldn&#39;t there be a revolution if it did change?<br />Phatic flow centred around topics seems to me invaluable.

  Kevin, I read in a techcrunch article about this that they said if you didn&#39;t turn off or lose battery power that you should be able to grab everything off the phone that&#39;s on the phone (doesn&#39;t do much for whatever&#39;s was stranded on the cloud, but probably would at least save your contacts). The article didn&#39;t go into detail about how to go about doing this, but I hope the info helps.

  Twitter gets me to the crib notes coming off the flow of what comes across my scans. I find it really valuable for that. Yesterday I was in Silicon Valley and Paris from my office in Emeryville. <br /><br />Facebook&#39;s more social. I see and share pictures with relatives. <br /><br />Neither spawns threads very well. <br /><br />A tweet brought me to this thread about tweets on Kevin&#39;s blog, inspired by his presentation. <br /><br />Blog as thread host, drawing audience from social nets. Next comes Wave with document as thread host. <br /><br />All very useful, each in its own way. Sometimes I&#39;d rather troubleshoot in a chat session so we have the transcript for later. <br /><br />The Xanadu design had micropayments for information, aka whuffle.<br /><br />Great job helping us make sense of this stuff, Kevin.

  There is a parallel to be drawn with physical privacy as well. We may not want to share what we do in the &quot;sphere&quot; of our own home with the rest of the world, so we create physical barriers for privacy in the forms of fences, walls, blinds, and so on. But I think it&#39;s easier to forget that others are watching us on the internet - we can see someone peering over the fence, but we can&#39;t watch their eyeballs read our tweets.<br /><br />Of course way more people can read your thoughts online than could ever fit in front of your fence. Something to consider as we travel about the web I suppose.

  I think you are right. the iPad is less a generic &quot;do it all&quot; computer, but rather a window into a richer connected world.<br /><br />The fact it happens to have storage (for music, books ans movies) is a great thing. The fact it can run native apps (if they can get there) adds some power and depth to the experience.<br /><br />While I may loathe a lot of Flash based sites however the thing that&#39;s stopping it being the obvious next choice for a casual machine for home (that I expect my daughter will be the primary consumer of) is the lack of Flash. Not because Adobe have some magical secret sauce but simply so much of what she expects to consume today (Shockwave, Facebook games, Club Penguin) relies on it.<br /><br />Sure. There are some sites and games that will make the leap to native iPad apps. Maybe some will get the same depth in iPad/Safari HTML5 but there&#39;s quite a cost for these folks to target the market and, catch-22, until they do the market won&#39;t exist.<br /><br />My immediate thought when I saw this was that it would replace the backpack full of dead-trees my daughter has to lug to 5th grade every day but without an entertainment aspect it&#39;s a very expensive option even if the classwork was available for it (and no pen means no handwriting which is another loss IMO)

  Still, the web had largely open technologies (HTML, CSS, etc).<br /><br />All you needed was a browser and a text editor. And you could mess around with the web. Make your own applications/sites, distribute amongst friends who were and weren&#39;t programmers.<br /><br />This is not so straight forward with the iPad.

  re: &quot;I would prefer it if anyone could distribute native apps for the iPad, but we all can create websites.&quot;<br />and re: your prior post on the Flow Past Web...<br /><br />One thing that is largely ignored in the market&#39;s zeal for native apps is that they are largely &quot;flow-past-web-proof.&quot; For example, in your FB News Feed, you can&#39;t tap a link to a video and watch it in an iPhone app. It needs to link to a mobile web site, which recognizes the iPhone/Pad user agent and serves the appropriate media for the iPhone/Pad. <br /><br />As more users engage in the flow past web on mobile devices, media companies will realize that good ole mobile web is the key to mobile content virality.

  Your comparison would be correct if all the social sites would already speak these standards. Currently we have a hen-egg problem. The splitting of identity providers and service providers has yet top emerge. <br />I think service provider startups would be happy if they could rely on an existing ID provider infra structure and could focus on the social featuere they want to create.

  Interesting points/ideas. One thing that would need to be addressed is that people often use different networking sites to interact with diff groups. The people/things I focus on in LinkedIn are not the same as with interactions on Flickr.<br /><br />Facebook&#39;s groups might be a good model to deal with this, but configuring them creates a lot of overhead for end users.<br /><br />Overall, I think the ability (option) to cross-post would be a huge step forward

  Good analysis to which I&#39;d like to add the disruption it&#39;s had on another service: Google Reader.<br /><br />Because Buzz following/follower lists are inextricably tied to your gReader list for some reason, if you were already using Google Reader as an RSS client and sharing with a relatively small group of friends, Buzz throws all of that into disarray.<br /><br />Now items show up in both feeds, and reading them in one doesn&#39;t mark them read in the other. Suddenly new people are looking to follow you and it&#39;s a mishmash of repeated posts with new replies, new shares in gReader from people you wanted to follow in Buzz but not in the RSS client and a Buzz feed that&#39;s full of stuff you&#39;ve already seen mixed with stuff that&#39;s Buzz-only.<br /><br />I really hope that once they finish fixing the privacy problems that they go back and do another pass on the usability.

  Buzz just seams to be doing the same that friendfeed has been doing for some time. I don&#39;t think it is like email, just presented in a similar fashion to the main gmail interface. <br />What it does do is try to gather some of the larger spread of the web that your friends may be sharing on into one location. Allowing a photo on flickr to spark a conversation that you can follow rather than getting lost on that one site.<br /><br />If you find that a conversation is rising to the top that you are not interested in then you can hide it but in general if a new conversation is starting about a post that you skipped over earlier then you will probably be interested in it and it should be at the top.

  Nice to hear someone outside academia talk about the phatic function of communication. You didn&#39;t mention explicitly in the This Week in Google episode yet you provided a clear description for it. Given the fact that the best-known description of the phatic function came from Malinowski and you have been providing nice insight into sociological dimensions of Buzz with Jyri, it sounds like the time is right for a thoughtful discussion of the truly social aspects of social media.<br />One can hope, can&#39;t one?

  That&#39;s awesome journalism Kevin. Patents are ideas, not technology, otherwise you&#39;d have to have a working example before it was patented. That&#39;s not true, no matter how complex the descriptions are. They are just ideas.

  Copyright abolition? Where did you get that from? I&#39;d like copyright to return to a more reasonable term length, and per Lessig, to require registration to renew after an initial term (eg 14 years), as the &#39;infinite term on the installment plan&#39; model isn&#39;t working.<br />Did you read the <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/pbr06_gowers_report_755.pdf" rel="nofollow">UK Gowers report</a>?

  Re: Tony above -- isn&#39;t it odd that we talk about the Turing Test as if it were a prize competition? Some of us talk about Scribe the same way -- as if the point were to get the sentence &quot;right,&quot; to match (or avoid) the famous phrase, or the one that we&#39;re thinking of.<br /><br />It&#39;s Scribe&#39;s deafness to context that makes it alarming, unintentionally funny, and potentially interesting. On Twitter, Robin Sloan compared it to surrealism; this is a good reminder that when most of us try automatic writing, what we get is a string of uninteresting clichés.

  Tony, yes, I remember Jaron Lanier <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/lanier/lanier_index.html" rel="nofollow">saying a decade ago</a>:<br /><i>Turing&#39;s mistake was that he assumed that the only explanation for a successful computer entrant would be that the computer had become elevated in some way; by becoming smarter, more human. There is another, equally valid explanation of a winning computer, however, which is that the human had become less intelligent, less human-like.<br /><br />An official Turing Test is held every year, and while the substantial cash prize has not been claimed by a program as yet, it will certainly be won sometime in the coming years. My view is that this event is distracting everyone from the real Turing Tests that are already being won. Real, though miniature, Turing Tests are happening all the time, every day, whenever a person puts up with stupid computer software.<br /><br />For instance, in the United States, we organize our financial lives in order to look good to the pathetically simplistic computer programs that determine our credit ratings. We borrow money when we don&#39;t need to, for example, to feed the type of data to the programs that we know they are programmed to respond to favorably.<br /><br />In doing this, we make ourselves stupid in order to make the computer software seem smart. In fact we continue to trust the credit rating software even though there has been an epidemic of personal bankruptcies during a time of very low unemployment and great prosperity.<br /><br />We have caused the Turing test to be passed. There is no epistemological difference between artificial intelligence and the acceptance of badly designed computer software.</i><br /><br />This has only got worse since then; in some ways the computers programmed to write and evaluate prose are analogous to the computers programmed to securitize and trade mortagages - they are growing large enough to outweigh and destabilize the human activities that provides their reason to exist in the first place.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  There&#39;s another cognitive dimension to Instant and Scribe: query commits may now happen at the level of the keystroke. These experiments only hint at where predictive text is going. Imagine a Google Instant Maps that slides, pans in, reorients, highlights landmarks, and suggests routes by process of elimination without your ever having left the search bar.<br /><br />Given all this, I wonder what becomes of the line between preview and commit. Will there still be a punctuating dimension to Enter, as in, &quot;I&#39;m finished my query&quot;? Or perhaps Enter as way of marking off shallow from deep(er) interest in what you&#39;re seeing?<br /><br />Besides the style convergence effect Kevin speculates about, there are opportunity costs tied to each thought dropped or deferred as the autocompletion draws your attention away from querying, towards results. Not that such costs should always trouble us; word processing augmented with WYSIWYG, spell check, auto-save, etc. has if anything improved my writing by knocking down barriers between the interface and my intent. I would hate to go back.<br /><br />Personal note: I used the <a href="http://scribe.googlelabs.com/" rel="nofollow">Scribe bookmarklet</a> to write this post. Arrow key behaviour takes some getting used to. It would be hella meta if we all conducted this discussion with Scribe turned on.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  This isn&#39;t just about Google - but about the insinuation that there are words - just words mind you - that are SO bad - no one should see them. Who determined these words and by what standards? How is that the word shit is determined to be bad? And who is Google to be the arbiter of such censorship? <br /><br />Shit, was a actual word, in an actual language, until someone, somewhere decided it was &#39;bad&#39;. In looking into the history of this sort of thing - it appears most swear words are designated as a means to &#39;cleanse&#39; the language - usually by the highly educated rich. The &#39;foul&#39; language, that used by those &#39;unwashed masses&#39;. <br /><br />There is something subtle and insidious about this move on Google&#39;s part to &#39;protect&#39; us from offense. Anyone who understands how such seemingly minor acts can manipulate a population would find this more than a little disturbing - I know I do. <br /><br />I leave with a video of a talk Christopher Hitchens gave in Toronto in response to legislation regulating &#39;hate speech&#39; they were considering at the time.

  &quot;That&#39;s clearly Sorkin talking.&quot; <br /><br />Yeah, he&#39;s such a sexist. Look at this West Wing bit: <br /><br />Sam: They have bathrobes at the gym?<br />C.J.: In the women&#39;s locker room.<br />Sam: But not the men&#39;s.<br />CJ: Yeah.<br />Sam: Now, that&#39;s outrageous. There&#39;s a thousand men working here and fifty women...<br />CJ: Yeah, and it&#39;s the bathrobes that&#39;s outrageous.<br /><br />Or this one he wrote:<br /><br />Ainsley: A new amendment we vote on declaring that I&#39;m equal under the law to a man? I am mortified to discover there&#39;s reason to believe I wasn&#39;t before. I am a citizen of this country. I am not a special subset in need of your protection. I do not have to have my rights handed down to me by a bunch of old, white men. The same Article 14 that protects you, protects me and I went to law school just to make sure.<br /><br />That <b>pig</b>. <br /><br />Or maybe it could be that <i>certain</i> college girls are attracted to success. You know, that dogged realism we want to ignore in lieu of being &quot;fair.&quot;

  Kevin, you&#39;re being somewhat &quot;unified theory of psychology&quot; here. Is it not possible that different people are motivated by different things, and these different movies show the differing motives. <br /><br />- There are some engineers who are driven by the desire to do something better<br />- There are some engineers who are driven to make piles of money and<br />- There are some engineers who are driven by the desire to get laid. <br /><br />That the Facebook movie (with its very obvious depiction of this fact), could be made in 2010 but not in 1951 tells us more about changing conventions about what we are and are not allowed to admit in public about our fellow humans than about the actual fundamental motivations of these humans. <br /><br />It seems like your complaint is directed more at reality than at the movie. Anne was the one and only programmer on the QuickTime team back when you were there, and from what my brother has told me, it&#39;s not like women are thick on the ground as engineers at Google. <br />You may not like this fact (though let&#39;s recall that Philip Greenspun has good reasons for why he believes it&#39;s anything but a tragedy), but you can&#39;t blame the movie for reflecting this reality.

  Hi Kevin<br /><br />Thanks for the pointer to this. I&#39;d love to find time to talk about it all more. Needless(?) to say, I agree.<br /><br />One thing I&#39;ve often told people is that a problem with the real-time web is that things like Twitter lack a locus for ongoing information exchange (publishing?) around an object. Twitter&#39;s annotations are a nod (but no more) in that direction. See http://blogs.fluidinfo.com/fluidDB/2009/12/01/putting-metadata-onto-tweets-with-fluiddb/ which allows both - a real time web but also something which is not by its nature so ephemeral.<br /><br />It seems to me that it doesn&#39;t have to be an all-or-nothing choice.<br /><br />I wonder if I&#39;m making sense? Anyway, very nice to read your thoughts &amp; thanks again. Let me know if you&#39;ll be in Barcelona or NY any time soon.

  Great post, this is an important role in community and I think about building culture and what you describe here is someone who can help shape that culture. I think many cultures fail when the mechanics that shape the community outweigh the cultural stewards.

  Excellent points, Kevin. One of the key questions for me is how much the Google app suite becomes associated with Android (I love my maps and google navigation!) and if users will become turned off if they buy a low cost device that says &quot;Android&quot; on it but doesn&#39;t have those apps - potentially a big branding isue for Google and for Android itself, as it invests more in the brand.

  No, this isn&#39;t fair. BBC America offers an HD version, it&#39;s not their fault if Comcast doesn&#39;t want to carry it. You can&#39;t get EPL soccer football on BBCA in HD either.<br /><br />The running time of the HD torrent was 43 mintues, so I don&#39;t think any scenes were cut to make the BBCA version fit around their commercials and annoying tutorials about &quot;what is a Dalek&quot; and all that crap. <br /><br />Regarding your complaint about the time zone lag with GMT, if that&#39;s all we have to complain about, things are pretty rosy.

  That&#39;s the clearest explanation of Open ID I have read. I always wondered how it would solve identification on the Web and just assumed I was misunderstanding something.

  The Brasil example did not break or tricked Gresham law. Gresham law only applies when government fixes the value of two currencies at an artificial rate (and even in that case the difference between the natural rate and the artificial rate has to be bigger than the expense to trade the currencies).

  excellent, It will take a lot of people to work long hours, but i think its all good. I Moderated ( actually it was termed &quot;poderator&quot; ) on Tripod for 180,000 ( Alt.Music ) users way back in the 56k modem days... and they had no troll management tooling, but a lack of raw connect horsepower limited the flow-rate of the junk. <br /><br />Now with 10 mbit connects and automation, a troublemaker can be 10,000 lunatic-fringe nutcases per minute... any autonomy simply enables the unruly population-polluting bunch to feel immune from reprisal. So something must be there to rain accountability over the whole situation.

  Kevin, I&#39;m surprised that you of all people don&#39;t see the big picture here.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t about disenfranchising the minority. Google isn&#39;t going after Twitter, LJ, Myspace, or OpenID, all of which support pseudonymous identities, and all of which failed or peaked at <i>millions</i> of users.<br /><br />Rather, it&#39;s going straight after the heart of Facebook, which has the <b>exact same</b> real name policy as Google+, and has a <i>billion</i> users. Google is deeply worried about the growing Facebook hegemony, where every day another site switches exclusively to a Facebook login as their primary (and often only) identity. And we should be too.<br /><br />The difference between Twitter, MySpace, LJ, OpenID, Friendster, and Facebook?<br /><br />Real names.

  if the stated aim is to reduce trolling and create a well mannered society surely the simplest solution is to permit the use of a pseudonym (or any other *nym the user wishes) provided you agree to tie it (secretly) to a real world identity via (for example) a token credit card transaction<br /><br />Right now G+ isn&#39;t worth bothering with for normal folks. Apart from circles (which FB will no doubt clone soon) there seems to be very little value and it certainly hasn&#39;t reached a tipping point in active users (most folks I know have tried it and gone back to FB) and creating their own artificial barriers and limits certainly isn&#39;t going to help them gain traction.<br /><br />Very few people online know me by legal name so enforcing it actually makes it harder for people to find and connect with me

  I don&#39;t understand why Google is shooting itself in the foot like this. A few years from now if G+ is a big enough deal to attract serious advertising revenue, they would have the ability to bully people into choosing a real name. Right now G+&#39;s audience is made up of a lot of technically minded people that really support the right to anonymity and these rumors and this this controversy detracts from its natural audience getting in love with G+. Without the unbridled support of early adopters, G+ will go absolutely nowhere in the face of such utter dominance by Facebook. With Facebook, you have big brands promoting their Facebook URLs in print and tv media, you have a large built in ecosystem of Facebook designers and advertisers listed at <a href="http://www.buyfacebookfansreviews.com" rel="nofollow">BuyFacebookFansReviews</a> and other similar sites that businesses rely on, and you have a large number of people that have contributed years worth of photos and tags and everything to Facebook that they don&#39;t want to leave behind. Google has enough of an uphill road ahead of itself in the social networking sphere that its sort of questionable why this was their policy in the first place. It squanders what goodwill they have among its core audience and detracts from its real issues. I hope Google wises up because its doubtful that anybody else will have the guns to take on Facebook and the market could use some quality competition that would benefit all consumers.

  @Anon27YzYrUB<br /><br />Facebook does not claim 1 billion users. It claims to have 750 million active users. A lot of those are corporate accounts, and some people will also run fansites or have more than one profile.<br /><br />http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics<br /><br />And to be fair, FB&#39;s attitude to privacy dimays me as much as Google&#39;s, to the extent that I do not have a FB account, and do not intend to open a G+ one.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  A little late, I know, but only just saw this post after lengthy summer break. Everything has already been said about the UK government&#39;s predictable knee-jerk response to the riots (blame someone, anyone, so long as it&#39;s not us or anything we might have been responsible for over the past few decades, like education, social justice, building communities...).<br /><br />So, just two points to add:<br /><br />a. I can appreciate anyone who also quotes a quote I often use in sessions when lecturing/presenting on new technology, namely:<br /><br />&quot;<em>1) everything that’s already in the world when you’re born is just normal;<br /><br />2) anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;<br /><br />3) anything that gets invented after you’re thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until it’s been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really.</em>&quot;<br /><br />and <br /><br />b. it would be interesting to know if Cameron had really thought through his plan to inhibit social media? <br /><br />Presumably he would not also be limiting the use of social media by political parties for fundraising and reaching new supporters in other demographics?<br /><br />Presumably he would not also be in favour of removing privacy controls on his own personal communications and those of his party?<br /><br />Perhaps a sign that the internet and its digital descendants (social media, social networks, virtual worlds, email) have finally arrived will come when governments do not still see them as a threat...

  You can call on FB Twit and G+ to change, but you shouldn&#39;t expect designers or publishers to shoulder the burden of fixing this. <br /><br />The issue for Designers and Publishers is that it&#39;s a decision of how many people see your information rather than whether the medium is the best display for the information. <br /><br />It doesn&#39;t do any designer or publisher any good if they use HTML and the work they do fails to spread because Facetweet+ prefers images. <br /><br />If images get shared more, they are worth more money and will be used more.

  I think some of this also has to do with SPAM, XSS, and SQLi attacks being carried out,<br /><br />In other words, it&#39;s easier for Twitter, FB, and Google+ to provide crude markup and favor images than it is to embrace the semantic web.<br /><br />Sanitizing all user input is expensive from a processing perspective. It also opens up the platform to new and as-yet discovered vulnerabilities.<br /><br />While I agree with you that the problem has gotten out of hand, I don&#39;t see any of those Companies changing their stance anytime soon.

  @vineeth wrote:<br /><i>In the end, reliable communication is what matters.</i><br /><br />As a web accessibility specialist, I am most concerned that the conveyance of &quot;reliable communication&quot; via images alone effectively shuts out a significant segment of the on-line community: those who cannot see those pretty infographics which are rarely if ever accompanied with the equivalent text (and no, @alt is not going to cut it). <br /><br />Meanwhile, a significant segment of the standardista community is actively seeking to eliminate accommodation mechanisms (a.k.a. the obsolete @longdesc folks) - often with the response that authors should include the textual equivalent of these complex images on the same page. Yet as we see here, this is simply not happening.<br /><br />This is not to suggest that retaining @longdesc will solve the problem - authors still need to invest the time and effort to actually supply the longer text, but mechanisms such as @longdesc at least provide a means of linking textual equivalents to the infographic (thus accommodating both the non-sighted as well as the &quot;semantic web&quot; requirements that are currently being lost) while still preserving the visual info-bite requirements that are driving this current trend.

  <span class="p-name">As i mentioned on Twitter there are two major reas...</span>
  <div class="e-content">
  
  As i mentioned on Twitter there are two major reasons I see them not implementing HTML embedding.<br /><br />1) Security. Yes, of course there are ways around this, but there are *always* ways around those security patches. If there wasn&#39;t, Caja wouldn&#39;t *still* be in active development. Having to handle security just so people can make text big red and blinking is far less a priority. Also, Caja as you mentioned needs SVN and Java. That&#39;s an immediate turn off for many, many engineers making these large sites. Most of these new big sites use things like Rails, Python, and now Node/JS.<br /><br />2) The other, probably bigger reason, people don&#39;t want to learn HTML to embed content. My mom, grandma, high school friends, etc, don&#39;t want to know &lt;a href=&quot;http://url.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://url.com/img.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to just make an image. They&#39;d much rather copy and paste a link. Simpler is better. This has been shown again, and again with consumer sites (and even enterprise now). Or to embed a YouTube video they want to copy and paste a link that generates the embed code. Same with all media. I think you have an engineers view and you&#39;re forgetting the majority of people.<br /><br />3. Shorter reason, I personally don&#39;t want to see crap like &lt;h1 style=&quot;color:red;text-style:blink&quot;&gt;CLICK THIS LINK BELOW&lt;/h1&gt;. That&#39;s annoying. I follow social media sites and people for the social aspects, I do not follow them so I can see Myspace style Twitter. Twitter also was meant to be a short message type network, why would you want graphs and marquees going on in your twitter stream.

Communication through graphics (or video) has the same utility that the written word has, the transference of knowledge. <br /><br />You seem to be arguing that to communicate with pictures is puerile therefore web services should prioritize accordingly when point in fact that strength of the web has always been its dynamism with regard to how information is presented and consumed.

  The article is right on the mark. It’s been bugging me for a while now that every other link I click on is an image containing… text and nothing else.<br /><br />As for infographics, I find that most of them hinder more than they help, so I skip any such links I see. (Mind you, I’m not the sort of person who believes images are evil or anything like that. I just haven’t seen many genuinely useful infographics.)

  Bookzer: I din&#39;t say this was trivial, I was noting a pattern. to respond to your points:<br />1. If embedding iframes is so bad, how come Facebook gets everyone to do that for it&#39;s like buttons on their sites? Twitter embeds end up injecting them via JS too.<br />2. is irrelevant. the cases I&#39;m talking about have UX to embed previews already, and youtube&#39;s copyable embed tags are a good counterexample.<br />3. the richer embedding is arguably how mySpace outcompeted the earlier SNS&#39;s; Facebook and Twitter found different paths. There&#39;s room for compromise.<br /><br />Jeff Nolan: fair point. Perhaps I should have been less extreme and said to think about what the right mode is, not pick one reflexively. I love good visualisations; I own all the Tufte books, but so many of the infographics are nothing of the kind.

  Hello Kevin,<br />I find it ironic that you post an infographic (from google , showing the increase in use of the term &quot;infographic&quot;) in a post saying how evil they are.<br /><br />But maybe the word has started to cheapen, and yes, if an infographic is just somebody&#39;s wank in illustrator, I agree such images are very irritating, but there is always a place for well-made tables, figures, charts and other data-driven visualisations. I regard these as infographics too!

  <div class="e-content">
  
  Who cares about HTML. I certainly wouldn&#39;t give any weight to it. Images are links. But I think the author is trying to say two things. <br /><br />1. A link with a text label should give the contextual text a greater weight<br /><br />2. A link to textual content should have greater weight than a link to an image.<br /><br />Ignoring the fact that &quot;weight&quot; is not giving to the link -- the link gives weight to it&#39;s destination - - both arguments are flawed.<br /><br />1. Images can have text labels. These can provide useful semantic information or be completely bogus. So you can&#39;t give too much credence to it.<br /><br />2. Almost all images that are provided in link (especially of the lolcats variety) are actually links to HTML and the image is embedded as an additional link within the HTML. All images are in fact links -- well, not exactly, but they&#39;re separate HTTP requests, which is what you mean when you say &quot;follow a link&quot;.<br /><br />I understand what the author is trying to get at, which is that textual information is more easily categorized than an image, and text embedded in an image (a la lolcats) is too difficult to get contextual information out of. In theory you could use OCR but it&#39;s not practical.<br /><br />You could use meta semantic markup, but like link text, it can&#39;t be trusted. <br /><br />Now there may be some weighting done if the text of a link such <a href="fijiaaron.com" rel="nofollow">Aaron&#39;s blog</a> matches the content of the destination some higher weighting could be given to it, but that&#39;s also easy to fake, because I could put bogus content on the destination with a font that matches the background and have my SPAM page content clearly displayed (perhaps in an image so a search engine couldn&#39;t detect that it wasn&#39;t relevant.)

  <div class="e-content">
  
  Here&#39;s the thing: a QR code is just a hyperlink. That&#39;s the best and worst thing about it. <br /><br />Ideally, it&#39;s a link to something that couldn&#39;t just be typed in on your phone faster or with better accuracy - which, with knowledge of the right programs, means pretty much anything that doesn&#39;t end in a .com is ripe for this technique. <br /><br />This idea that QR codes are something the average person doesn&#39;t get is ridiculous. Okay, the FIRST time a person sees this, they&#39;re going to have questions. BUT once they know what it is, and have the right app on their phone (Google Goggles for Android works best for me!), things speed up and become much faster. <br /><br />The real problem is how they are IMPLEMENTED by designers, not received by users. Maybe avoiding them is best for dumb designers, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re still not useful -- just that they can&#39;t be used without some better judgement.

  While QR codes are often clunky and hard to use now, I imagine that will change. Once it gets to the point where 95% of cell phone owners can point their phones at a code, hit one button, and get to the content instantly -- as opposed to going through the far too many steps I have to go through to scan a code with my phone now -- they&#39;ll be a lot more useful.

  But image processing is good enough nowadays that there&#39;s really no point to having QR codes anymore. If you can pull out your camera &amp; snap a photo of a QR code, you can pull out your camera &amp; snap a photo of a URL.<br /><br />It should be pretty straightforward to write an application that looks for what appears to be a URL (whether in alphanumeric, or straight numeric IP address format) and asks you if you&#39;d like to view the result in your web-browser.<br /><br />So, any value (other than possible aesthetics) that comes from using QR codes could just as easily be gained through image processing of URLs.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  QR codes are problematic in some ways, I&#39;ll agree with that. There are limitations, and some of the promotional applications of the codes are incredibly short sighted. QR codes at the bus shelter was a classic example. Having said that, my kids know what they are, and clammer to scan them when we see one. Regardless of the subject matter. <br /><br />In addition, as a teacher, I&#39;ve found them to be very handy. I&#39;m currently using them with a new resource I&#39;ve built with for my students www.feedbackbadges.com ... it&#39;s an experiment in their usefulness, as well as encouragement and motivational awards. Kids love them. <br /><br />So I do think they have their limitations, but they ARE eye catching, inspire some inquiry, and in the classroom engagement. <br /><br />Finally, they have been around for years now, and show no sign of disappearing. Clearly, they are working in some applications. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Martin Jorgensen<br />www.martinjorgensen.com<br />@mnjorgensen

  QR codes are not just for URLs - you can include other details in them like contact details etc or a text &quot;more info&quot; explanation neither of which do you need a network connection for.<br /><br />If you&#39;re just using them for a URL, sur include the URL as text too.<br /><br />No reason to slate this as a &quot;bad&quot; innovation.

  <div class="e-content">
  
  I think the point of a QR Code is being missed here. Outside of commercial uses (product tracking etc.) QR Codes are powerful marketing tools that are squarely aimed at the smartphone generation. QR apps such as QR Pal create a diary of codes scanned, so they can either link straight to the page or choose to be stored for the user to call up later. Most QR code readers are also much quicker than an app that needs to use optical character recognition to decipher text and then automatically recognise it as a URL.<br /><br />Used in the correct context, I think QR Codes are hugely valuable marketing tools. In my business, the bottom of our menu says in clear text &quot;visit our Facebook page at ... or use your smartphone to scan this QR code and check in to let us know you&#39;re here.&quot;<br /><br />Clearly, different users are going to view such tools in different ways. The next generation of adults are smartphone-centric and QR codes will be second nature to them, but marketers still need to be mindful of the users who don&#39;t have such devices or who don&#39;t understand the technology and ensure there is a clear marketing message for them, too.

  For me, it comes down to trust of the folks who created the message that contains the QR code.<br /><br />If I look up the company for myself, I get to mediate that flow of information, in my own way. If I scan a QR code and it opens my browser for me, I&#39;ve just let some marketing creep pick the exact information that I receive.<br /><br />Cute idea, but I think that ultimately they&#39;ll be relegated in history next to the &quot;splash page&quot; on web sites.

  Interesting idea.<br /><br />A good example of a company that does this is Fender. Several of their guitar models have an American version and a Mexican version. Both are good products. Apparently the American lines have a higher resale value and come from the factory a bit more polished (e.g. frets sanded down nicely), but otherwise they&#39;re the pretty much the same.

  Only actual &quot;use&quot; I ever got out of QR codes was a treasure hunt for the kids I set up. That has to be non-obvious and deciphery, so the obscurocity is a feature, not a bug, in that case.<br /><br />Other than that, there is nothing a QR code can do that e.g. a bit.ly link can&#39;t do better.<br /><br />/Z

  you may also find the term used quite a bit in discussions about the health care insurance industry grouping people into artificial categories just because they happen to work for the same company. Those groups are sold by the employer to the insurance company and the individuals getting the insurance have none of the upside of being a customer, they were the product being sold.

  Yes you are absolutely right. People true those who is known to him. The parameter is face, does he knows by face. Many people we meet regularly, but don’t even know his/her name. but compared to a people how talk to you over phone. You trust the unmanned person so to speak.

  Great post, Kevin.<br /><br />&quot;Publicly readable edit histories&quot; ought to be available for every public document, news story, web page of any public import. This not only provides accountability, it frees us from the dead hand of print-think and lets us use the digital medium&#39;s qualities appropriately. We should free ourselves to be able to continually improve our articles/posts/information.

  This is a beautiful idea, and one that nicely maps to the way I frequently re-find content. <br /><br />However, the &quot;link to an arbitrary place in a document&quot; problem isn&#39;t that challenging. You might take a look at <a href="http://simonstl.com/articles/cssFragID.html" rel="nofollow"><br />Using CSS Selectors as Fragment Identifiers</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/cssselfrags/" rel="nofollow">CSS Selectors as Fragment Identifiers Community Group</a>.<br /><br />The two approaches have different failure modes. Yours needs more infrastructure, but certainly seems less likely to reach porn sites by accident.

  This is very similar to Gervase Markham&#39;s fragment search: http://blog.gerv.net/2007/02/fragment_search/<br /><br />He proposes using #!s![search term] and allows #!s[number]![search term] to find the n&#39;th match on a page.<br /><br />He provides a greasemonkey script that works in many browsers. He also proposes using #![other letter] for other purposes.

  Hi Kevin,<br /><br />I really like the fragmentions concept, and it looks very useful for an issue we&#39;re trying to solve right now on our (very large) Drupal site which is in development, so I turned Jonathan&#39;s script into a Drupal module.<br /><br />It&#39;s in &quot;sandbox&quot; mode at the moment, but can be downloaded through the module info page below if people would like to try it (it does work! :-):<br /><br /><a href="https://drupal.org/sandbox/ocean/2247743" rel="nofollow">https://drupal.org/sandbox/ocean/2247743</a><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Drew Robinson

  I think this is a very exciting enhancement to linking on the web, although there appears to be some conflict/bleed over??? with single hash # anchor links. I gave it a test drive on one of our sites and posted some of my observations on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/id-hash-anchors-highlighted-content" rel="nofollow">WP Fragmention support forum</a>.

  If there is more than a single step to using a QR code, they are a non-starter. My 15 years of software design tells me that if it two clicks or more, only the geekiest will even try it. It doesn&#39;t matter how cool your ideas are if no one wants to bother using your app.

One of them making an ad absurdum remark about conscious sunlight (please at least cite a Star Trek episode), another making a nonsencial reference to Romney offshoring, and a third with a generic kamasutra icon offering the all caps message &quot;I LIKE YOU&quot;. So it looks like G+ is gaining in popularity and diversity. <br> <a href="https://plus.google.com/109182513536739786206/posts/AFYXt9Uz2wu" rel="nofollow">via plus.google.com</a>

I would argue that it boils down to the types of people who contribute here are still early adopters. One of the key contributing factors to being an early adopter here is being fed up with other social networks.

My memory may do some filtering of its own, but I believe YouTube comments (generally among both the most incivil and useless of the sites I may frequent) once were readable too.  There may be a social entropy in any group, an arrow from signal to noise, civility to incivility. Groups more rarely go in the opposite direction. The Rise and Fall of Usenet is probably the most extreme example of this. <br> <a href="https://plus.google.com/109182513536739786206/posts/AFYXt9Uz2wu" rel="nofollow">via plus.google.com</a>

  <a href="https://plus.google.com/117719018968843715932" rel="nofollow">Jonny Axelsson</a>: A Facebook wall discussion is usually not so incivil, as the wall is kept reasonably decent by most owners. Group discussions is a different topic. Facebook unlike G+ has discussion software (so the two are not directly comparable). I have tried it, used it, and am not too impressed. On the other hand it is evolving, and might improve to something useful.<br><br>Basically entry comments have been extended to discussion. Every member can create an entry, every member can comment on every entry or comment, forming running discussions displayed in reverse chronological order. Moderators and entry authors can delete entries (including comments added by others), moderators and comment authors can delete their own comments. Lately they can edit their comments, with edit trails. Users can block each other (and moderators...), they will then be invisible to each other. Moderators can ban users. There are no other forms of censure. <br><br>The upshot is that even moderate activity can completely obscure a discussion, until recently even basic linking were obscured, so just a few posts could make a discussion hard to find. A small number of comments would make a discussion hard to follow. And Facebook can scale up very rapidly, with a group that used to have dozens of members could have thousands of members a few weeks later. When you have thousands of members, each thread easily get thousands of comments, that you can only see by going back 50 by 50 messages. In practice it is a mess. <br><br>Whatever the original document says I have yet to see a rating system to counteract social entropy. But a rating system could make it feasible to handle very high volumes, based on post ratings by users and personal ratings/relationships to users. <br> <a href="https://plus.google.com/109182513536739786206/posts/AFYXt9Uz2wu" rel="nofollow">via plus.google.com</a>

  <a href="https://plus.google.com/106784868338928174619" rel="nofollow">Ian Walker</a>: +Dan Hiester, I was going to comment on the genesis of these networks too, but my recollection of facebook is different from your description. However, I was not an early adopter, so I can&#39;t speak to that. I only found my way there when the youngsters were picking it up and I remember it had a reputation for being &quot;used at colleges&quot;. <br><br>It seems to me that G+ has come out of a culture of tech-oriented innovation and one-upmanship, as opposed to what I think of as facebook&#39;s birth as a smart post-adolescent&#39;s social experiment. <br> <a href="https://plus.google.com/109182513536739786206/posts/AFYXt9Uz2wu" rel="nofollow">via plus.google.com</a>

  <a href="https://plus.google.com/115055492383043273066" rel="nofollow">Dan Hiester</a>: My personal theory is that G+ is now what Facebook was at MySpace&#39;s peak. It&#39;s the everybody network. At the time, Facebook was more for technological elites. The people there were there because they were interested in learning new things. But now Facebook is the everybody network, and G+ is largely adopted by technological elites, the few people with the patience to deal with more than one social network.<br><br>I have no data to back that up and can be completely wrong, though. <br> <a href="https://plus.google.com/109182513536739786206/posts/AFYXt9Uz2wu" rel="nofollow">via plus.google.com</a>

Basically noisy participants repel or change less noisy participants more effectively than the opposite. Since there always is an influx of new social platforms, the net effect is to move the less noisy ones to newer platforms (or corners of existing platforms). <br> <a href="https://plus.google.com/109182513536739786206/posts/AFYXt9Uz2wu" rel="nofollow">via plus.google.com</a>
