<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://jeremy1.wordpress.com'>Jeremy Silver</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Welcome to Digital Catapult - we're partly funded by government, partly by business - we're here to encourage the early adoption of advanced digital technologies, and tonight it is immersive video and VR
<p>we've been investing in immersive technology over the last few years <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/BecGC">@BecGC</a> has been leading this here
<p>we have a lab here that is a showcase for the technology and for the projects that have built these kind of projects - lodon, belfast, gateshead and more
<p>we have also set up a volumetric capture studio in Wimbledon at <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.dimensionstudio.co/">https://www.dimensionstudio.co/</a> that digitises real actors
<p>Jeremy Bailenson founded the VR lab at Stanford in 2003 to explore Virtual/Human interaction - he wrote a book called Infinite Reality and his new book is Experience on Demand
<p>we look at VR and AR and AR on mobile - where is it going?

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have no answers for what's winning in the Valley - watching the crazed consumer revolution come and go, nobody knows what will win out
<p>the companies that are still surviving is the ones that use technology to chase the problem 
<p>start with a problem that needs to be solved, if VR or AR helps to solve it, great. Don't use the technology for the sake of it
<p>The big companies began with the premise that people want to play games in VR, but people are now thinking of other applications
<p>companies have learned that you can't play for 10 hours a day in VR - it can be too intense
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://jeremy1.wordpress.com'>Jeremy Silver</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the clearest theme that runs through the book is the power to increase empathy - you have been pioneering a different use here
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we were funded to develop VR to do better diversity training - we based it on work in London labs - we made a virtual mirror that shows a different body that followsyour reflection
<p>no medium causes empathy, it's what you do with it - VR will outperform video for empathy if you do it well
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://jeremy1.wordpress.com'>Jeremy Silver</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>you have done a number of pieces where the viewer has the experience of someone very different from themsleves
<p>we have one in our lab that give the experience of being homeless - to encourage people to have empathy and changing mindsets
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Becoming Homeless is a piece we were challenged to do by the Robert Wood Johnson foundation - to see if empathy transferred for broader than just undergraduates
<p>we have a large sample - over 3000 people and a broader range of people to try the experience
<p>we designed control conditions designed to outperform VR, and looked at behaviour over time - looking 2 months after the experience
<p>the goal was to reverse the fundamental attribution error - when things happen to us it's about the situation; for others it is about character
<p>when we end the experience we get people to sign a petition "I am willing to have my taxes raised to help the homeless" - and this still seems to apply 2 months later
<p>there have only been a few studies that look a day or 2 out, not a month ot

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://jeremy1.wordpress.com'>Jeremy Silver</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Mel Stevenson has been working in Barcelona with the Ministry of Justice, working with the perpetrators of domestic abuse to simulate them being subject to it -the recidivism goes down 30% compared to control
<p>The more we see of that evidence, the more we can think about tools that create lasting value
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the reason why we can posit that it creates an effect - walking VR, fully immersive , people respond to them as if they were real
<p>we should begin with the assumption that VR is an actual experience, and plan on that basis
<p>we wrote a chapter on the Dark side of VR - we moved it to Chapter 2 so it would come through. The reviewers seemed to not see this and accuse me of being too optimisitic
<p>how do we make sure VR doesn't get dragged down with the social media quagmire?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://jeremy1.wordpress.com'>Jeremy Silver</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>you have a very strict rule of no more than 20 minutes exposure - we're used to the idea of long form being the ideal
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have yet to find a VR experience that can last longer than 20 minutes - take them, off touch a wall talk to a person
<p>I think VR is amazing for special experience - it's not for reading email and doing social media
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://jeremy1.wordpress.com'>Jeremy Silver</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the corporate business plan wants us to be in it all the time, like Ready Player One
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>That's not my vision - the people stumbling on it anew are bringing the media template of many hours a day - the lightfield approach tries to make it more comfortable
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://jeremy1.wordpress.com'>Jeremy Silver</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>i was very struck when I read the book by your recurrent refrain of warning - does that need some kind of regulation?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have been talking to  US lawmakers and their ideas of VR - I'm not for regulation, and for free speech - the FCC said it's not their jurisdiction
<p>Zuckerberg went through this big experience in front of congress, and did any laws change?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://jeremy1.wordpress.com'>Jeremy Silver</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>if you think about AR and mixed reality is that less overwhelming?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>VR is complete mental transplantation; for AR it is more about augmentation and distraction
<p>nowadays it seems if people can't really walk unless their thumbs are moving. one of the google founders said that Google Glass meant he could finally lift his head up at parties
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://jeremy1.wordpress.com'>Jeremy Silver</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>is the hazard less with AR?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>The hazard is different - they show demos liek repairing sinks, but in practice they play Pokemon Go
<p>I want VR devices to turn off if you are going 3 miles per hour or more
<p>you didn't think people would play Pokemon Go while driving cars, but they did
<p>I talk on the phone while driving; I know I am distracted. 9 people per day are killed by drivers on their phone
<p>lets use this as a moment - I don't want to hear about passengers and driverless cars - I want VR not to work in a moving car
<p>Training is a good use case. I was asked if we coudl use VR to train athletes - we built a simulator to train quarterbacks
<p>when the quarterback goes to the line he has about 3 seconds to change the play based on the defence. We simulated this in goggles
<p>Derek set up a startup called Striver which sold this training to many sports teams - I'm a co-founder and we now have 75 employees
<p>Walmart is based in Arkansas and saw the American Football training - we have a Black Friday Rush simulation for them
<p>Walmart has training academies for employees - we found that the VR trainign helped. We then paired 30 stores with VR training and 30 not - it showed better.
<p>we have trained over 200,000 welmart employees using VRin the last 12 months
<p>we simulate a flooded basement with mould everywhere for an insurance company called Nationwide to train claims people
<p>with the traiining we are mostly doing capture with 360 video rather than 3d simulation
<p>we get people to try out the experience, and see how it affects people, and then go back and try a different approach

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We work on vivid content - sensorially interesting - what do have that is beyond audio visual?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we just built a project based on smell - making a Vegan patty smell like a real beef one
<p>
<p>we did a study where we tried people with a donut - half with a haptic donut, half with scent of a donut
<p>we weren't sure if we would see satiation or priming, but we saw more satiation with virtual donuts
<p>we originally overdid the smell in the smell study

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>people keep saying VR is a fad that will pass in 5 years
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I wish social media would pass in 5 years
<p>with mental health there is a home run use case - this is way mroe important than the gaming cases
<p>we know from many published studies that people can be distracted from physical pain by VR - but hospitals don't offer it
<p>we put researchers and doctors and pharma companies togetehr, and they want a 1000 patient study in a medical journal not a tech one
<p>with PTSD research in the US, they can't get reimbursement from the VA

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='BBC'>Cilla Watson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>what were the most interesting ideas from the new interest in VR?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>location based VR with passive haptics works very well when it is done right - walking through spider webs with string on your face
<p>One of the simulations is called Hero where a helicoptor drops a bomb on a village you are in, and you pick up pieces of rubble - the tracking was off and  I hit my face on a 2 by 4
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>i'm from Sheffield Hallam univeristy - most examples have been for VR users learning their own skills - what about carers for others - eg helps teachers take care of diabetics
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>a lot of academic research has looked at experiencing other people's journeys - difficult conversation generator 
<p>you have this difficult conversation, we record your audio and gestures, then you experience it from the point of view of the other person - what you were doing to them

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Isabel from immersive rehab - we're dealing with regulatory trials - we use a fully immersive Vive - what is coming standalone?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>for us $400 for the HTC Vive is a dream price compared to the $10,000 we are used to.
<p>Stroke rehab is a great use case - please keep working on that. The standalone stuff I like - you don't have to set up cameras
<p>the hololens you don't get the dizziness as much, but the inside out you can get some fuzzyness - always go for tracking accuracy

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Yasmin - I do training for implicit bias - how do we do longer term behaviour change?
<p>I'm working wiht a bunch of investment bankers to try to make them nicer to women - how do you deal with that?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.experienceondemandbook.com/'>Jeremy Bailenson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm tired of diversity training that ends with "aha I'm biased" - you want to teach them how to improve - eg show them a heat map of where they look comapared to a woman or a man
<p>then you let them redo it and see how to do better.
<p>we see people say somethign intensely inappropriate, then show them it and let them retry and improve it from the other point of view
