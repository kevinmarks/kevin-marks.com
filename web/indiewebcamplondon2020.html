<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://rosemaryorchard.com'>Rosemary Orchard</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>My website is at <a class="auto-link" href="https://rosemaryorchard.com">https://rosemaryorchard.com</a> and whenever I have something to post, I don't think about whether it should be on twitter or instagram, I post it to my site first
<p>When I want to post, I can use any client - I like to use Quill <a class="auto-link" href="https://quill.p3k.io/">https://quill.p3k.io/</a> so when I post ti goes to my site first, then can be shared to <a class="auto-link" href="http://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> or twitter too
<p>I can try and read instagram posts, but unfortunately facebook is very unfriendly to anyone outside the facebook world
<p>I remember when myspace went away and took our history with it - by putting all my likes and notes on my own site, I can stop this from happening again
<p>I can build my own profile on the internet rather than relying on some tech giant in america that may not have my interests at heart - I know that I have my own interests at heart
<p>I run on wordpress, but there are lots of options - if you want something to start quickly I would recommend <a class="auto-link" href="http://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> - if you want help getting started come to <a class="auto-link" href="http://chat.indieweb.org">chat.indieweb.org</a> and we'll help you

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://cheuk.dev'>Cheuk Ting Ho</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>another option to start using indieweb is with github pages - it's completely free and you can use jekyll to edit it

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.lewiscowles.co.uk/'>Lewis Coles</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm at <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.lewiscowles.co.uk/">https://www.lewiscowles.co.uk/</a> - I hack around with my site by hand - I have an all text blog and try things out by hand. I use fragmention to scroll to content, but you have to opt in
<p>I did start in jekyll, but it is entirely typed in by hand in vscode and uploaded

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://cheuk.dev'>Cheuk Ting Ho</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>My site is at http://cheuk.dev - I just upgraded again and took my articles out of medium and onto my own website. I don't have webmention yet, so I want to link that up this weekend

I try and put everything I produce on the web in one place

I've moved my RSVPs to my site and makes a calendar link for me. I also publish them out to meetup
<p>I own all interactions with twitter - and I've been enhancing those to show more context

<p>it's currently on 2 different systems - a mixture of a custom CMS in PHP and jekyll for the posts, and I am going to try to make that simpler
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://barryfrost.com/'>Barry Frost</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>my personal site is <a class="auto-link" href="https://barryfrost.com/">https://barryfrost.com/</a>. - I built it about 5 years ago initially when I went to my first indiewebcamp at MIT
<p>I like to put all my content in one place, but I like having reactions wit hpeople on twitter and instagram in one place too
<p>I don't post enough, I find it more fun to write software. My site is on github and is written in ruby and uses a lot of indieweb tech
<p>my content is on github as flat json files, that gets turned into a database on heroku - I built my own client app at <a class="auto-link" href="http://micropublish.net">micropublish.net</a>. which you can use with your site too
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://ohhelloana.blog'>Ana Rodrigues</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have a blog at <a class="auto-link" href="https://ohhelloana.blog">https://ohhelloana.blog</a> since 2014, which was wordpress then converted to jekyll - I have bookmarks
<p>I have micropub and webmentions, but I didn't like the way they look, so this weekend I am converting to eleventy as I understand js better than ruby

<p>I post to my site using a mobile app called indigenous, which uses micropub, and I read with a microsub client at <a class="auto-link" href="http://alltogethernow.io">alltogethernow.io</a> 
<p>because the feeds are held in aperture I can read them all in this reader
<p>I'm also using a personal wiki for a more considered set of work at <a class="auto-link" href="http://commonplace.doubleloop.net">commonplace.doubleloop.net</a> - making it more of a commonplace book - the more i use the wiki the less I use the blog
<p>I have made a micropub client in emacs as I don't like the wordpress content editor - I can write in emacs and push stuff to my site that way
<p>I've also made a custom wordpress theme built on underscores and it was quite easy as the microformats came from the Post Kinds plugin

<p>I don't make new features anymore - I debate whether I should rebuild it. 
<p>You can log into my site with indieauth and can see some hidden posts including checkins from swarm
<p>I do like the idea of having a static site, but doing this on a static site would be harder

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://doubleloop.net/'>Neil Mather</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I was inspired by the Own your RSVPs session - I used Jamies code to convert meetup events into h-feeds
<p>I put these into my social reader in aperture
<p>I then can post RSVPs to my own site, and then can use <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> to send it to the external service too
<p>I have wordpress set up so that when I create an RSVP post it can be syndicated to <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> as well, so I've sent a pull request to Syndication Links for this
<p>by doing this <a class="auto-link" href="https://doubleloop.net/kinds/rsvp">https://doubleloop.net/kinds/rsvp</a> has a list of all the places I have RSVP'd to, which you could follow to discover events
<p>next I want to addd an iCal feed for all my events
<p>it was very easy to add new things based on the building blocks and how <a class="auto-link h-cassis-username" href="https://twitter.com/dshanske">@dshanske</a> has structured the WP plugins

<p>I added webmention support and display to my static site using fluffy's webmention.js
<p>I added a feed of torrents of all my videos as I'm using a lot of bandwidth now schools have been sent home
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://calumryan.com'>Calum Ryan</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I've been looking at Kirby as an alternative to my handcrafted CMS, so I converted my posts into flat files to put into Kirby
<p>a lot of the problems have been with character encoding and getting the emojis through. I was looking at a static site generator before
<p>I started building a weather plugin for Kirby to add that to posts
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://carolgilabert.me/'>Carol</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I refactored my RSVPs - I used to have to add them manually; now I list them in a json file and loop though to add them to the page
<p>that should make it easier to get micropub set up on my site

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://suze.dev'>Suze Shardlow</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>my website is served through github pages based on jekyll and liquid - I thought I should use more indeweb principles, and it was like getting a new bookcase and then hoovering the whole hous
<p>so I ended up changing my layouts to make them more DRY and use includes more; now I want to implement webmentions instead of discus
<p>I also set up weblogin and managed to log into indieweb wiki - I need to change my canonical url to suze.dev from <a class="auto-link" href="http://suzeshardlow.com">suzeshardlow.com</a>
<p>I also added myself to the chat list on the wiki. I have staked the claim with rel=me on my site, and next is an h-card
<p>I found a lot more motivation to do this today with having other people doing ti too, and thank you to <a class="auto-link h-cassis-username" href="https://twitter.com/ohhelloana">@ohhelloana</a>, <a class="auto-link h-cassis-username" href="https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho">@cheukting_ho</a> and <a class="auto-link h-cassis-username" href="https://twitter.com/calum_ryan">@calum_ryan</a> for organising this very well
