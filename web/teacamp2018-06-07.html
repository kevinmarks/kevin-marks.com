<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.flyingbinary.com'>Dr Jacqui Taylor</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>it's amazing when we look at how we got here - I was originally in the cabinet office in the attic, now we have the open government partnership - working to make government transparent
<p>last time I was here was talking about bulk release of open data, and came to teacamp asking for people to help. Local Goevrnment delivered in  6 weeks
<p>as a result of that, Francis Maude created 30 open data champions and that has spread further
<p>I work in the European Council - my official title is Agent Provocateur and I work on the digital single market with the 28
<p>I have worked with GDPR since 2014 
<p>GDPR grew out fo the transparency agenda for making government accountable, but we won't make data open when it is personal data
<p>there has been a lot of GDPR snake oil - I want to debunk some
<p>people say "GDPR is like Y2K" - Y2K was a technical problem to solve based on an error; GDPR is about the Digital Single Market - a new governance model for personal data
<p>GDPR is an enablement capability
<p>Myth: GDPR went live 25th May 2018 - no, we have been working on it since May 2016; the rest of the world woke up early this year
<p>the Data Protection Act from 1998 is not sufficient for the modern web 
<p>I cofounded the data journalism industry, and Snowden made it visible, with Cambridge Analytica making it more obvious
<p>Service Design is at the core of this transformation - civic design first
<p>We built GDPR as an enablement and an opportunity
<p>Another GDPR Myth is that you can just switch to a new version of your backend. You need to demonstrate compliance, and showing how you deal with subject access requests are key
<p>You also have to prove that you have deleted data that you are required to
<p>another Myth is that GDPR can't be policed; the Information Commissioner has had teams out doing risk assessments already
<p>From an information security point of view you can't pass off the risk as a data controller to a processor - the cold calling industry was against GDPR rules as they were set up
<p>GDPR is about building our web world with privacy at the core - so citizens can trust us
<p>once we get to IoT and distributed models, the traditional trust model doesn't fit
<p>you have enabled devices in your house- I have seen an electronic doorknob that wants you to register your family name and address - the opposite of privacy by design
<p>Secondary processing is not allowed - you have to have explicitly got permission for any processing you want to do
<p>The payoff from GDPR has been a big reduction of email after I didn't re-engage with anyone who mailed me
<p>Making sure that local government engagement has been defenisble on legal grounds was key
<p>from a UK PoV in May 2017 we launched the NHS GDPR service to enable it for Trusts who are all transactionally based
<p>If you move on from an OpenData agenda to a Shared Data agenda, you are looking at it from a security point of view
<p>85% of EU cities are 250k to 500k - I have written a White Paper on governance for cities
<p>The first city to launch with this standard was Dubai; the first nation was Russia
<p>This shows that this is a global market for how privacy should be handled
<p>China is going to build 200 new cities and retrofit 250 exiting ones, based on these privacy models
<p>Keep an eye on my tweet stream for events UK wide

<p>This is going to be a big project before brexit and setting the baseline for that too.
<p>you don't start by transforming the whole of Yorkshire, you build on what is already there -an All Party Parliamentary Group is the best way
