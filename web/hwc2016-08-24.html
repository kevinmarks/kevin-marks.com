<p>I teach at the Cronkite School of journlaism at Arizona State, and I still write for slate. back channel and so on
<p>I'm working on a book about how we can keep control of what we write compared to the centralising tendency
<p>My blog is very simple, but meant to be independent
<p>when I teahc journlaists, I get them to but a domain, set up their own hosting and create a blog or webiste 
<p>I want them to have the experience of installing the software on a server and setting up their own things
<p>We normally use reclaim hosting, which is set up by former university popel fro this, and it is $33/year inc domain
<p>I insist they do something new, whether it is their first site. They often have no idea they can do this
<p>Facebook should not be your internet presence. They need to know what is possible
