<p>Who has something they would like to show that they've done with their website in the last 2 weeks? (Or longer if it's new?)

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://dangillmor.com/'>Dan Gillmor</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm at <a class="auto-link" href="http://dangillmor.com/">http://dangillmor.com/</a> I've known Kevin for about 15 years I used to be journalist at the Mercury News on tech
<p>I teach at the Cronkite School of journalism at Arizona State, and I still write for Slate. back channel and so on
<p>I'm working on a book about how we can keep control of what we write compared to the centralising tendency
<p>My blog is very simple, but meant to be independent
<p>When I teach journalists, I get them to buy a domain, set up their own hosting and create a blog or website 
<p>I want them to have the experience of installing the software on a server and setting up their own things
<p>We normally use Reclaim Hosting, which is set up by former university people for this, and it is $33/year inc domain
<p>I insist they do something new, whether it is their first site. They often have no idea they can do this
<p>Facebook should not be your internet presence. They need to know what is possible

<p>I tried setting up a website for my girlfriend's business idea, I got a theme set up but generating content was hard
<p>I've maintained websites, but I haven't built any from scratch

<p>I built it through <a class="auto-link" href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a> and maintained it there, but now I'm going to build it from scratch 
<p>Now I'm at GoDaddy I should be able to host it here, so I get to do it again
