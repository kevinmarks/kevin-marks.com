<div class="e-content">
<p>What I was trying to do today was monkeypatch my <a href="http://known.kevinmarks.com">Known site</a> so that it used an updated version of fragmention rather than the old one on withknown.com. However, I typo'd the script include line so that it reads:
<p><code>&lt;script src="http://www.kevinmarks.com/pushyfragmention.js&gt;&lt;/script </code>
<p>This manages to put the rest of the page inside a script tag and so became blank.
Because known includes this header prefix in the editing pages too, I can't undo this mistake. 
<p>It also apparently breaks micropub posting, and certainly micropub auth and login.
<p>You can however still read the site as <a href="http://known.kevinmarks.com/?_t=amp">AMP</a> or <a href="http://known.kevinmarks.com/?_t=rss">RSS</a>. Which has a certain irony. 
<p>I think I extended the meaning of Tantek's <a href="http://tantek.com/2015/069/t1/js-dr-javascript-required-dead">js;dr</a> tonight anyway.
