<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/kathrynlouisegeels'>Kathryn Louise Geels</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>This is part of an EU project called Vital Media - Ireland has an ecosystem of innovative companies that is similar to what we see at Catapult
<p>There is a wider initiative in europe called NEM - New European Media <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/NEM_initiative">@NEM_initiative</a> <a class="auto-link" href="http://nem-initiative.org">nem-initiative.org</a> - do sign up for that
<p>the EU commission are looking at a lot of aspects of Social Media - consumer privacy and trust being key there - we have brought some of that with us today

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.nevalabsHQ.com'>mark little</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I was a troublesome student - I was a bit of a rebel. We are very proud of Sam Beckett at Trinity, but also of Walton cracking genetics
<p>there is backlash against technology companies at the moment - it reminds me of Hegel's dialectics - There is a Thesis, a clashing Antithesis, and synthesis that gets it together
<p>the Thesis is the realisation is that individuals have powers to express themselves on social media that we have never had access to before
<p>I used to be an anchor on television - I was able to ask twitter "I have the minister for finance on tonight -what should i ask him?"
<p>Twitter completely revolutionised the means of production of news - speaking to a mass audience without the gatekeepers like me
<p>I was no longer the voice of god talking to a passive audience, but they were responding and making me a better journalist
<p>I was seeing a more authentic voice online than any foreign correspondent could provide by hearing it directly
<p>the democratic potential of having no-one between you an your audience was thrilling
<p>the antithesis is how do you decide who to listen to? We made Storyful to try and make sense of all this
<p>when I went to work at twitter I started to see the antithesis further - big platforms are a contradiction
<p>we are rows of corn to be harvested by big companies into data and sold to advertisers
<p>so we need . synthesis - what do we do/ do we leave it to platforms or governments to fix this?
<p>the last thing I want is a politician coming in and telling us how to do this - I see the lack of curiosity about what they call "the twitter"
<p>I don't want the platforms to be given the power to self regulate either - they now know that they are potentially like big tobacco
<p>I have 5 princicples we shoudl be listening to as we think about this
<p>Design is 1st - look at the design of systems and their unintended consequences - how they're open to manipulation
<p>we have a business model based on advertising that creates the worst incentives - toe centralise within a walled garden
<p>the systems are designed to keep people unconsciously addicted to a system based on bad emotions
<p>be aware of the problems that your design can cause
<p>Decentralisation is the 2nd principle - we need to being it back to the individual - we need <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/cshirky">@cshirky</a>'s here comes everybody thinking
<p>we need to think about NLP to create taxonomies that connect individuals on topics thta matter to them
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/girlondon">@girlondon</a> is working on an accelerator thinking about how to create better connections between individuals and journalists
<p>3rd thing is Incentives - money. we need new models that are not about advertising, but not necessarily like paywalls either 
<p>Capital too - if you're a VC it's all about growth, about getting an exit. Growth shoudl not be the core of the design of these new systems
<p>we should be exploring new ways of financing companies that don't have this vC growth mindset
<p>could a blockchain smart contrect be used to create different incentives to create value rather than engagement
<p>I am exhilerated by the potential still - when I see criticism I agree with about 90% of it, but Time Well Spent is encouraging
<p>what I don't like is the sense that we are powerless in the face of that technology
<p>as Ed Burke of Trinity said - all that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing
<p>we need to unlock the potential of social media - the machine is designed by humans and we need to design for humans too
<p>Sam Beckett's line "Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better." is what we need

<p>ADAPT focuses on the empowerment of people through media
<p>Design is a key aspect of social media <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/mckibben23">@mckibben23</a> has been working on this here
<p>there have been scare stories about GDPR from journalist, but we do need to use it to change behaviour

<p>performers don't need to be musicians - composers, sound engineers and anyone else involved in music production is as well

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://fussy.ai'>Fussy</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we want to stop independent restaurants having to place high placement bids to advertise against big chains
<p>restaurants always depend on influencers -food critics, michelin guide, Yelpers now instagram micro influencers
<p>restaurants don't have the time to find influencers and advertise to them
<p>influencers receive free meals with a value based on their Fussy Score - pictures of food are one of the most engaging types on instagram
