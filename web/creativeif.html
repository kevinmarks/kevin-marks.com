<p>most Catapults are verticals - digital is more of a horizontal, we help businesses move up the adoption curve
<p>we think about where different sectors are on the adoption curve - creative industries are the most digital of all
<p>Creative industries are being disrupted on a regular basis - the business models are always evolving
<p>the UK is a real player in creative industries, with global reach.
<p>There are  limited sources of funding in the UK - we aren't funders, but we build tools to help create it
<p>if you look at where AR & VR are growing, we can see content markets beginning to grow
<p>the demand for content is a lot stronger with many new services that are commissioning it
<p>Music is comping back to growth for the first time in 15 years, but the value isn't always getting to the artists
<p>one thing we are good at in the UK is mixing public and private funding for creative arts

<p>over 90% of the creative industry is freelancers, and access to finance is a limiting factor for them
<p>if you go on youtube, trending every day is a video of cats - is this the wisdom of crowds, or folly?
<p>freelancers and creatives pivot most days of their lives, between clients, projects and different sectors
<p>the creative industries are £87B and grew 34% between 2010 and 2015 - bigger than the construction sector
<p>The UK is .00012% of creative and cultureal trade - we can grow a lot from this
<p>94% of the creative industry is small companies; 43% of the workforce are freelancers
<p>the team behind Angry Birds made 51 games before Angry Birds took off
<p>Angry Birds only took off after they explained the motivation of the birds, and why they were angry
<p>there are 2 approaches - Aggregate or Curate and curation is winning out
<p>sites curate for you - staff picks, based on genres, based on popularity and more
<p>Goldfinch entertainment started curating investment in creative industries - bringing other investors in
<p>last Thursday they pivoted into Goldfinch Studios - now a digital production company with their own distribution
<p>this model of curating investment needs more exploring - its like kickstarter but for bigger investments
<p>There is a cruise ship company in the town of Papenburg in Holland, pop 37,000 - 50 miles from the sea
<p>no-one thought that Papenburg would dominate cruise ships - this is patient finance - been there since 18th c
<p>we need this kind of patient investment, not just the 3-5 year horizon, but something that will last and grow
<p>If you give a good idea to a mediocre team they will screw it up…
<p>If you give a mediocre idea to brilliant team they will either fix it or throw it away for something better
<p>Aardman made Wallace and Gromit for  £11,000 - now their value is huge - they employ over 600 people
<p>Glee - one of the most successful TV shows started off as a web series
<p>I found 80 writing competitions in one day - most are very small
<p>Danish Broadcasting got writers in a room and wanted original works, and made Borgen, The Killing and The Bridge
<p>The Killing revised the funding for TV Series - 10 Danish writers changed the world of english speaking drama

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@BecGC'>Becky Gregory-Clarke</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Becky Gregory-Clarke lead technologist for immersive technologies
<p>CreativeXR is a programme of content-led R&D
<p>immersive tech has a potential fro new creative formats - a new medium to tell different stories
<p>we have the creative culture, but there is not enough content for consumers to buy into immersive
<p>it's hard to invest in AR because: lack of uptake; lack of monetisation options; formats are unclear 
<p>because we don't have a clear set of content types and formats, we don't understand the audience
<p>content-led R&D can be difficult to define and justify - may need to tie to a research or tech question
<p>if you are solving a problem for the users, you have a product. If youare not solving a need, it's harder to define
<p>having enough trial and error time like Angry Birds is difficult to justify in advance
<p>if you add in uncertainty about headsets and devices, then that makes it even harder
<p>the only way to solve the lack of content is to make content and learn to make it better
<p>this also exposes the pain points in the production tools and models - content led helps here
<p>the kind of learning-on-the-job R&D is somethign small companies are used to doing
<p>I used to commission new content ideas for the BBC - we made 6 or 7; 1 was great, 3 we learned a lot, 3 less good
<p>doing more lets us see the range of different possibilities rather than picking one
<p>Funding is not the only difficulty - you need to do some early idea development before commissioning
<p>there isn't a clear commissioning structure in VR and AR, and there is a big gap in early stage content funding
<p>you need to spend the time on early idea development - CreativeXR is meant to support that early stage ideas
<p>we have a12 week programme with new experimental consumer facing content from Arts and Culture
<p>up to 20 companies will receive up to £20k of funding, and access to digital catapult facilities
<p>and end with a chance pitc to content commissioning funders
<p>we want artistic and cultural experiences; new storytelling; new interactive entertainment
<p>and they must be using VR or AR technologies

<p>we have a broad collection of work - some are simple flash games, some are more Arts projects and a VR game
<p>Killbox is a game we made  - a short form game thta lats s10 minutes and explores drone warfare
<p>it was really designed for museum and gallery exhibits, and also worked as a performance space
<p>there was space for 2 players and audience to watch - there was a performer who would mark kills on the box
<p>as a collective we have done a bunch of AR projects - a 2015 at national museum of scotland and projection art

<p>I work with a distributor as part of the funding effort - not enough producers think enough about who will see it
<p>I always think about what is the log line that will sell a film to an audience
<p>I think of theatrical distribution as the first thing - though I wouldn't turn down a Netflix deal
<p>I look at comedies, rom coms and thrillers, but not dark dramas
<p>I found that "Chalet Girl" was seen as too middle class and elitist, so now I'm looking for broader appeal
<p>I am a classic cottage industry producer - I don't have an overhead deal, no finance umbrella

<p>I just switched from being a creator to working with the AHRC on digital economy projects
<p>I am trying to get universities working better with the creative sector
<p>if you count by number the creative industry is SMEs; but not if you look by turnover
<p>there is a lot of research done by universities about the creative sector, but not much experimental work
<p>we want to support key sectors of the British economy with R&D and the creative industries matter too
<p>Creative R&D doesn't really follow the industrial model lifecycle - the content cycle is different.
<p>Creative businesses thrive better when they cluster together and share workforces  - it gives a career path
<p>it acts as an attractor for career paths too as there are multiple jobs
<p>we want to fund 8 clusters and bring university research that is about experimental forms of media 
<p>we want the universities to understand what business's challenges are and fund research that supports SMEs 
<p>we're getting a lot of proposals that are a bit too university-like and not businessy enough

<p>there are people who won't apply to us, and we want to drive more applications from certain places
<p>there are places like backpool, luton and slough where we don't get applications so we work to get more
<p>we find there are places we don't get any applications from at all

<p>so eg the National Theatre makes money but goes back to the NT
<p>the Lottery money can't be used for a profit making business, so we have to be careful there

<p>we want to try to demonstrate how they could add value to other organisations
<p>so not commissioning something for the foyer, but how an artist could bring creative thought in
<p>we want to foster those relationships - we had 10 by 10 in Sunderland -10 artists with 10 employers
