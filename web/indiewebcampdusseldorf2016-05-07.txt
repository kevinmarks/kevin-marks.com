#indieweb @aaronpk: our principles are at http://indiewebcamp.com/principles and #3 ðŸ’ª Build tools for yourself, not for all of your friends. is key
#indieweb @aaronpk: if you don't want to use your tools for your own site why would anyone else?
#indieweb @adactio: today is a day of discussion and figuring stuff out, tomorrow for implementing
#indieweb @adactio: I'm always amazed by how much gets done in a weekend by being in a space with other people who can help out
#indieweb @aaronpk: we're going to do some demos, brief introductions and show your website and something you're proud of or working on
#indieweb @t: my website is http://tantek.com/ I post photos and likes and notes and whatever I find that si interesting
#indieweb @t: I have person tags working on my photos, so here's me and Julie, and it cross posts to twitter, facebook and flickr
#indieweb @t: brid.gy does this for me - as the person tags are supported by bridgy they end up on the silo sites too
#indieweb @t: what i want to work on this weekend is having deletes and updates go out to the copies on other sites
#indieweb @adactio: my site is adactio.com - I have a blog, but more recently I added notes that I post and share out to twitter
#indieweb @adactio: I can upload photos, so let me show that on my phone - when I'm logged in I get an interface
#indieweb @adactio: what i might add is twitter posting wiht apis
#indieweb @adactio: so I'm taking a photo here on my phone and uploading to my website
#indieweb @adactio: here's a photo I uploaded earlier in the pub last night: https://adactio.com/notes/10610
#indieweb @adactio: it gets uploaded to twitter and flickr as well, and brid.gy brings the comments  and likes back to my site
#indieweb @adactio: this is using brid.gy which send you webmentions and you can get this up and running
#indieweb @aaronpk: here is a photo on jeremy's site and I want to post a comment on it
#indieweb @aaronpk: I'm using https://quill.p3k.io/ a tool for posting using micropub, and can post a reply to jeremy's note
#indieweb @aaronpk: I am getting a beer emoji and posting it, and crossposting to twitter
#indieweb @aaronpk: I made a tool to help you get webmention sending working at http://webmention.rocks
#indieweb @aaronpk: we'll do a session on webmention later today and do some hacking on it tomorrow
#indieweb @adactio: don't be shy, come up and say who you are and show your website

#indieweb @vandrijevik: there is a print stylesheet as my mum likes to print it out
#indieweb @adactio: part of this is using your own site for things you'd use silo sites for - travel, photos, checkins
#indieweb @sknebel: I'm Sven, sknebel on IRC. My site is http://www.svenknebel.de/ - I can receive webmentions but I don't display them yet
