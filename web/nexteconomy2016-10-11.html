<p>the food industry is synonymous with minimum wage
<p>in food there is a huge informal economy  - there are 2 million professional cooks and 10s of millions more
<p>We think there is a more holistic food experience that the commodified commercial businesses
<p>our cooks are largely folks excluded from the professional world - 75% women, 30% minority
<p>Crystal used to run block parties and local music events, and sells gumbo through josephine
<p>the government sees the economic value, and the grey economy that was impossible to regulate before
<p>we want to be more proactive - we are currently a  private marketplace. we sponsored state level legislation
<p>we have a new permit process for home kitchens at state level,
<p>20% of th company is going to be allocated in cooks starting in 2017 - we are working out dividend models too

<p>the impulse is to publish, so it takes control to hold back like this
<p>All the big publications have their hit stories from time to time

<p>the person using periscope did not expect the feedback loop, but without it they wouldn't do it again
