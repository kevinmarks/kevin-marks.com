<p>the food industry is synonymous with minimum wage
<p>in food there is a huge informal economy  - there are 2 million professional cooks and 10s of millions more
<p>We think there is a more holistic food experience that the commodified commercial businesses
<p>our cooks are largely folks excluded from the professional world - 75% women, 30% minority
<p>Crystal used to run block parties and local music events, and sells gumbo through josephine
<p>the government sees the economic value, and the grey economy that was impossible to regulate before
<p>we want to be more proactive - we are currently a  private marketplace. we sponsored state level legislation
<p>we have a new permit process for home kitchens at state level,
<p>20% of th company is going to be allocated in cooks starting in 2017 - we are working out dividend models too

<p>the impulse is to publish, so it takes control to hold back like this
<p>All the big publications have their hit stories from time to time

<p>traingin a large model is super computationally intensive - trillions of flops
<p>we ahd to make special purpose hardware fro the neural network tasks so that the costs din't blow up
<p>we ahve so many translations and speech recogntion to do we need to automate further
<p>our datacentres are pretty automated, but our Iowa datacentre has 100s of employees there too
<p>we want the workflows to be as automated as possible so the peopel can work on the exceptions
<p>it's not a cost thing so much as an agility thing -you  need to follow the curve when you have demand

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://plus.google.com/+UrsH%C3%B6lzle'>Urs Hölzle</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>a lot fo the grid is built on 50 year old technology
<p>we were able to use AI to find the right knob to make cooling 40% more efficient, could do that fro the grid
<p>IT is very inefficient, especially on-premise - by concentrating in the cloud you can mix workloads 
<p>if you do the heavy lifting in the cloud you can have a phone not a PC, and save 2x energy

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://plus.google.com/+UrsH%C3%B6lzle'>Urs Hölzle</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>The key thing is to make cloud really accessible fro the average company - thousands of companies can benefit 
<p>someone was able to build a satellite imagery cloud removal tool in cloudML - improved it by a factor of 4
<p>a novice was able to make a huge improvement using an alpha version of the tool we have
<p>just as mapreduce made it possible to process a lot of data as a non-systems person, cloud machine learning can
<p>there are big opportunites in understanding data and improving search - the idea behind google now and assistant
<p>you don't want to waste time copying and pasting as a consumer - the same is true for enterprise
<p>you're limited by your ability to apply technology, not the opportunity to make a difference
<p>Google was about organising information and making it accessible; cloud does this for technology too
<p>this is different from 'here's virtual machines' - here are rich tools

<p>you need to try things out - the Airbus cloud removal didn't think it would work that well
<p>machine learning has an opportunity to create jobs by doing things more practically than before
<p>I'm an optimist by nature, by running large infrastructure you have to have a sunny approach to survive
<p>There is a big change coming over the next 20 years, but we are better prepared than the industrial revolution</blockquote></div>
