<p>supermarkets don't have a way to advertise things in this time sensitive way

<p>when I my wofie heard I was investing in a dating app for beards, I had a lto to explain
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://m14.industries'>John 🌈 Kershaw</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>my story begins with bristlr - I invented a joke to connect those with beards to those who want to stroke beards
<p>this took off by surpise, and so I joined <a class="auto-link" href="http://ignite.io">ignite.io</a> - I found saying "tinder for beards" to investors didn't last long
<p>there used to be tens of thousands of dating websites out there, but they collapsed with the rise of apps
<p>if you were match or tinder great, but if you are "lonely norfolk farmers dot com" there is no SaaS for you
<p>we fixed this with M14 industries to make a niche dating app backend for you http://m14.industries
<p>I could tell you all the good things, but I'll tell you how I fucked up instead
<p>I have guided everythign with a post-it note that says "why will it fail?"
<p>you need to keep looking for the holes in your startup boat that would make you fail, and patch them
<p>there are only 2 problems with startups: 1)other people 2)myself
<p>1st problem: no traction - everyone keeps app ideas secret, whereas telling people gets you feedback
<p>2nd problem: investors don't care - most don't care about what you do. talk to enough to find one that cares
<p>3. your chosen industry sucks - we found this with the dating industry - it's full of smoke and mirrors
<p>you can turn this into a strength by identifying the things that are the worst and embrace it
<p>5th problem: I am bad at CEOing - software skill and CEO skills are different
<p>being a CEO is really really hard - skip it with less then 10 people.
<p>Burn Out is a really big problem. I've burnt out several times on bristlr and m14
<p>my first diary mention of burn out began 3 months into bristlr
<p>I wouldn't say I was enjoying my job, but that I wouldn't have any other job
<p>Bristlr and M14 went on Dragons Den earlier this year, and we didn't fuck it up
<p>Dragons Den was hen on Goggle Box, and that was even weirder
<p>between applying to Dragon's Den and appearing on it, I had 2 birthdays

<p>the best business model is a B2B service where you make what costs a hundred  grand and sell it for a hundred quid
