<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://archive.org'>Brewster Kahle</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm unaware of a group like this who has come together to strategize on what is working and not on the web
<p>today is Builders' Day: we are coming here in a needy way to work out how we can work together
<p>Tomorrow is Public day - more like a conventional conference with 300+ people here and keynotes
<p>and the third day is a public open day which is more freefrom
<p>the web has been unbeliveably successful, but centralization has made parts of it stagnant
<p>at the internet archive we make snapshots of the web, but it doesnt' capture an increasing dynamic web
<p>we can't ignore the privacy issues especially after Snowden
<p>and we need to keep the web fun and interesting as it goes forwards
<p>I've never been in a group where we have vint cerf, tim berners lee and the next generation building new tech
<p>I'm going to ask Mitchell Baker, head of the mozilla foundation to give her ideas:
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/'>MitchellBaker</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>as we think about the decentralized web and building the web, we need a shared idea of the web we carry forward
<p>the web should be immediate: safe instant access to content via a universal address without the need to install
<p>when you access the content you should not need a relationship to see it - no intermediariries
<p>the web should be Open: anyone can publish content without permission and provide access as they see fit
<p>The web should be Universal: content runs on any device or platform
<p>The web has Agency: the user agent can choose how to interpret content provide by a service
<p>the user needs an agent on their side to help them. That is why we still build firefox
<p>Chrome is built to get fastest access to data on a server; Firefox to act for the user
<p>the web through interoperability allows technology on behalf of the user to mediate the entire experience
<p>If we can keep Immediate Open Universal Agency then the web remains decentralized
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://archive.org'>Brewster Kahle</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the only way I can come up with to be reliable and private is to change some of the basic structures of the web
<p>thank you Wendy Hanamura for bringing us all together
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://archive.org'>Wendy Hanamura</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>you've got to love Brewster because he always thinks big
<p>this started last february when Brewster was asked by 5 foundations to think about the future
<p>he said we want to lock the web open for good, and bake our values into the code of privacy and openness
<p>we called this builders' day - but builders aren't just coders, we're going to need philosophers and anthropologists
<p>we're going to need storytellers too
<p>first you need to know each other, then find principles you can agree on, then plan and collaborate
<p>Brewster said we can get the original architects: Vint and Tim, and the team building the open browser: Mitchell
<p>we asked you what you wanted, and you asked for real connections and knowing each others' technologies
<p>we also put you into breakout groups; I know many of you could be in several of these, but you need to pick one
<p>you're in the temple of internet here, we provide free wifi to anyone in range of the building
<p>this building was built in 1923, which is the date before which everything is out of copyright which is prophetic
<p>Gunners law: 1:when your head is bursting, express the most important one. In a group of N talk 1/N of the time
<p>now I want you to introduce yourselves: Name; where you're from; what you want

<p>we are about to move into a phase where your laptop is less useful
<p>put your device to the side and rise
<h2>Breakout Group report back</h2>
<p>1: no reliance on politcal stability disagree on who can restrict others and on accountability
<p>1: there is a tension between equal access and visbility
<p>1: we want to build a standard way to address content and self-soverign identity that is cryptographic
<p>1: we want to build a peer to peer encrypted channel without a central authority
<p>1: hard to avoid regulatory capture
<p>2: agreed on talking bout governace, interop, extensibility and cryto
<p>2: there is alway some form of governance so we need to talk about it
<p>2: interop - define minimum standards or building blocks not a monolith
<p>2: community standards of censorship resistance and dealing with harrassment and abuse
<p>2: lost fo discgreements on enryption and signing
<p>3: agree that decentralization is a means not an ends
<p>3: division of control baked into the infrastructure to resits capture and enclosre
<p>3: emphasise the idea of the end user able to interface wiht the decenntraised system not a center
<p>3: disagree on whether kinds of tech are bad or good or factors
<p>3: complicating factors around access to kinds of data
<p>3: how to prevent recentralisation and an endless loop so we'r not back in 15 more years
<p>4: agreed on no central authorities -aspiration that files are content adressable
<p>4: disagree on need to replace ICANN especially multi-state
<p>4: idea: court institutional support for decentralised web
<p>5: agreed we should be working systemic decntralisation on top of technical requirements
<p>5: decentral governance is necessary to rpesevre decentral tech
<p>5: content accessibility is import but has lots of sub-parts - rootless identifiers
<p>5: not require http but map to multiple protocols
<p>5: security requirements baked in on day 1; privacy baked in
<p>6: agreed on openess of access and public data stored so everyone can access it
<p>6: some disgreemnet about free of charge to the public access
<p>6: disagreement on the idea of filtering and whether people are putting their data on the networks
<p>6: and disagree on how you define sub-groups - inclusively or exclusively inherently
<p>6: the hard problem is how you define the boundaries of groups

<h2>Van Jacobson's Named Data Network</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://j-nelson.net/'>Jim Nelson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Just before this started a young guy showed up and wanted to show Van Jacobson his networking stack
<p>If we can decentralize the internet, do we need to worry about decentralising the web?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson'>Van Jacobson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we want to do both. There are incredible things happening in the dentralized web that will change the world
<p>the web chanegd the world, but it was build on IP which assumed telephony point to point connectsions
<p>you may find that what you want to achieve with a decentralised version has problems with the IP basis
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://j-nelson.net/'>Jim Nelson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>in Named Data Network a packet has  name duRI not an IP address. How does that work?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson'>Van Jacobson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the web chanegd our model of how the world works - for most people the internet is irrelevant except for the web
<p>wiht the web you give a name and get informtion back - it is a transctional model and we shoudl not build on that
<p>rather than building on top of the web, we should push that transactional model down the layers
<p>when you go to <a class="auto-link" href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a> you run a stack of protocols, but as a user I think of it as a data hierachy
<p>if your view of <a class="auto-link" href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a> is  as a set of machines, you need to wrap them in certificates to check
<p>in the NDN model you announce the name, and use that to look up. You can't trust where you got it from
<p>you have to get the trust from the information itself, not form where you obtained it
<p>the basic structure gives a packet the url of where you got it from and a signature that asserts it is an answer
<p>any security model that we are capable of building today needs certificates and addresses
<p>when the data is not reliant on the network path you got it from but can be from anywhere, it works in new ways
<p>what you are asking for is more important that the path back to you, so it can be asked anonymously too
<p>the current abstraction means the router can't know if the endpoints have got what they needed. we can fix this
<p>because the information is write once it is all cacheable
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href=''>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>why is it better to do this at the lower level and not on top of IP?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson'>Van Jacobson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we have a lot of structural problems with IP -
<p> with about 2Bn users of the 6Bn world population it is hard to add the next people
<p>the IP routing model encourages monopolies to form - it is hard to deploy in rural areas
<p>one of the problems that Vint and the IAG discussed at length was how to get from phone to new protocols
<p>you need a strategy to get from where you are to where you want to be - IP works as an overlay on anything
<p>so you can run NDN over IP, but you could also run IP over NDN
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>how do you find the performance difference between NDN vs BDN/IP?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson'>Van Jacobson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>an IP identifier is very restricted; NDN is just a hierarchical structure, not special
<p>the extra cost with NDN is the security as producer has to sign every packet, which takes more work
<p>the sender is trying to prove to the receiver that they should receive that information
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>a lot of our specs are open source and open standard for adoption. Is NDN open source?
