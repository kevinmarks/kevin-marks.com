#xoxofest @dooce: the day that I realised that my child had been written into my contract. I had to walk away. 
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I din't have any business experience before I got the job of CEO of my own company 
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: my last for-profit job before becomeing CEO was bagging groceries at a thriftway
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I did this show for This American Life called The Giant Pool of Money on the economic crisis
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: The same tools we are using to tell stories about heartbreak and love we can talk about exotic financial derivatives
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: Planet Money became very successful - and showed that we could apply these skills across a range of stories
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I thought "this podcast thing could work" - I thought I learned I was good at business through the t-shirt project
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: we made almost $600,000 and sold 25,000 t-shirts, so I thought "damn am I hot shit" - we're making money
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I love NPR and public media, but they're not the best business people in the world. I thought I could do better
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I thought the Startup podcast was going to be a publicity stunt, but it ended up as a suprisingly emotional journey
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I went to pitch @sacca, which is like just learning to paint and asking Jeff Koons for help
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: why don't we use a foreign name, and we ended up in Esperanto - with 'Orello' - it's Ear in Esperanto
#xoxofest @abexlumberg:  the startup narrative often gets told in hindsight with all the bad bits cut out - I wanted to leave them in
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: when you are deciding how to share out ownership, you have to pretend you have a big valuable company when you don't
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: every time we put out an episode I thought people would turn on me and they'll realise that I'm an awful person
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: but every time we did share the pain other people told us "I went through that too!"
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: we ended up raising $1.5M in seed money and it wasonly  after the podcast went up we sealed the deal
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I thought I could go on my track record, but nobody got it. When I did it and it got attention it became an example
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: I was explaining how I was going to make a narrative with pathos, and then I did it
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: You are never going to able to explain the thing as well as you can by showing the thing
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: Our revenue in the 1st year was $2m thanks to insanely high ad rates, but after @dooce's talk we need another stream
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: a year into it I am seeing things happen that I had no idea would happen. @PJVogt and @Agoldmund came in early
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: they kept coming up with new credits for Matt "Matt Lieber is a window in room where you didn't think there was one"
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: [plays the beginning of https://gimletmedia.com/episode/36-todays-the-day/ ] which is a great 4th wall breaking episode
#xoxofest @abexlumberg: the reason we're all trying to start things is to make a place where things we hadn't imagined can grow
#xoxofest @waxpancake: our next speaker is a force in Indie comics - C Spike Trotman
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: you heard about million dollar podcasts and million follower mommy blogs, it's time to think small again
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: like a lot people, I say "I don't know what I'm doing" when I'm asked what i do, and people agree with me
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: the 1990s were the high water mark for comics, but all but one distributor collapsed 
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: there was a boom in independent comics - independent is anything that isn't a guy in spandex with visible muscles
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: but the one remaining distributor raised the minimum order size and wiped out all the indie comics
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: but then webcomics happened, and the bar to entry went from very hight to really low
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: when webcomics took off we were seen as line-jumpers, dilletantes, ushering in the death of the newspaper
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: it felt kind of like trench warfare with webcomics and traditional publishing in separate lines
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: and after years of trench warfare Kickstarter showed up and I thought "this is going to be amazing"
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I did a book a book called "poorcraft" based on how to get by when you are poor, 'cos with webcomics I knew about it
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: people said "anyone who can raise $13,000 on kickstarter shouldn't be using kickstarter"
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I called it Iron Circus Comics because I already owned the domain,  and it was better than Invincible Dachshund 
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: If you search for me on the internet you'll find my women's erotic comics anthology, Smut Peddler
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I thought "I like porn, I don't like any of the porn being made. Oh, I should make some porn"
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: to be in Smut Peddler your comic needs to stress consent and mutual willingness. You'd think that was a low bar, but…
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: to be in Smut Peddler there needs to be a woman involved - the writer, the artist or the colourist
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I got so much pushback on the woman thing, though I also got lots of creepy letters about the consent thing too
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: Wow, I sure do sell a whole lot of stuff nobody wants. 
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: Kickstarter then had the 'message the author' button right next to the "report this" one, so I got some odd messages
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: This started a lot on kickstarter - this opened up the floodgates for support for other things
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I'm really into artists getting paid. You'd think that would be obvious, but not so
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: I want to put things out there that I don't see - that I'm told people don't want.
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: A New World is about your adventure being someone else's disaster
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: there is a group that think their TV and comics and games ae under threat from people not like them
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: there have always been black people and brown people and women and queers and trans in comics, we've always been here
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: this is not a fight. It's over. We're here, we've always been here. if you have a problem with it I don't really care
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: Comics was comfortable. Superhero stories in comic book shops and movies about men in tights is not all there is
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: the goalposts for unprofessional keep moving all the time "that will never work" becomes "that doesn't count"
#xoxofest @Iron_Spike: You can sit on reddit or tumblr and say that my comics don't count, but you are literally, verifiably wrong
#xoxofest @waxpancake: [standing ovation for @Iron_Spike] - I love it when that happens
#xoxofest @waxpancake: Suck started 20 years ago, I found it early on and read it every day. These 5 have never been on stage before
#xoxofest @waxpancake: Suck definitely skewered the dot com bubble and the hype of the time. They influenced Gawker and The Awl and more
#xoxofest @anamariecox: "oh shit"
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: This is the 1st time all 5 of us have been on stage together
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: all the questions that we are going to address today are not in panel format
#xoxofest @hhavrilesky: we're not a panel we're on the couch
#xoxofest @bigtimcavanaugh: and when you are on the couch it's therapy
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: Heather asked "using the powers of your imagination, name one way that suck changed the world"
#xoxofest @hhavrilesky: it's hard to tell if you are part of the wave or you created the wave - when everyone else is doing the same thing
#xoxofest @bigtimcavanaugh: from day one what Joey and Carl did was use the link as way to make a rhetorical joke
#xoxofest @bigtimcavanaugh: Now I write for regular newspapers where you have to write Barack Obama, the presidnet of the united states
#xoxofest @anamariecox: Steven Johnson wrote an essay about how we used the link, he made a career out of explaining what otehr people do
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: now we're in the TLDR era, before it was the RTFM era. Now if you say RTFM they say TLDR
#xoxofest @anamariecox: we put a lot of thought into what we were doing "this is supposed to be an inside joke, but everyone is in on it"
#xoxofest @anamariecox: with the links, even though we were know-it-alls, you could follow them and know as much as we did
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: our insight that was right on the money and it helped no-one was that we should publish every single day
#xoxofest @guydeboredom: lets give credit to the beautiful backend that meant we could schedule posts months ahead, even though we never did
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: I don't know if anyone remembers hotwired, but they didn't give a crap about design 
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: everything we did was centered with a centre tag, and there are probably theses written on how this is no way to read
#xoxofest @hhavrilesky: is this a therapy session about how great we are? I never have therapy like this.
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: Who was owen thomas really? Did we ever know him
#xoxofest @anamariecox: Owen Thomas could spell better than any of us. He was the copy editor and was hired after I was doing it.
#xoxofest @hhavrilesky: Owen would stand by our desks and talk to us and we looked oddly at this as we only used email and never spoke
#xoxofest @anamariecox: A gossip columnist should be hated
#xoxofest @hhavrilesky: I used to make cartoons that portrayed them all as a bag of dicks and they were gleeful about it - pure sociopaths
#xoxofest @hhavrilesky: 
#xoxofest @anamariecox: the penetrating insight that Filler showed didn't match up with the dim person who sat next to me
#xoxofest @hhavrilesky: this is my dipshit facade, my curtain
#xoxofest @anamariecox: clickhole is the suck of today - I wish we had been as absurdist as they are now. we kept trying to make sense
#xoxofest @bigtimcavanaugh: at the time everyone was interested in web millionaires, and we were web thousandaires
#xoxofest @JoeyAnuff: I hired Ana off a listserv where she would argue with Steve Albini and those guys
#xoxofest @anamariecox: I was in NY on $20k and you offered 2x the salary my dad said "2 men you've never met are flying you to SF to suck?"
#xoxofest @waxpancake: Our next presenter is one of my favourite writers - a raw prolific talent with a surreal sense of humour
#xoxofest @waxpancake: A huge hand for Mallory Ortberg
#xoxofest @mallelis: don't eb too hard on yourself if you are currently being too hard on yourself
#xoxofest @mallelis: death is coming for all of us. you can laugh about it but it will still happen to everyone in this room
#xoxofest @mallelis: The internet is where we all live. The toast is my internet, if you want one you can get your own.
#xoxofest @mallelis: so many sites say they want to pay writers eventually; we decided to do it from the start, so we keep doing it
#xoxofest @mallelis: It turns out there is a lot of space on the internet for people who make stupid jokes about art in the public domain
#xoxofest @waxpancake: you have something you can buy things on in your pockets -buy @mallelis's book now
#xoxofest @waxpancake: Anil's makerbase is IMDB for projects welcome @anildash
#xoxofest @anildash: if you were a time traveller from 1999 you'd be excited by technology's progress - flooz=bitcoin; VRML=Oculus
#xoxofest @anildash: Aaron Swartz is known as an activist and a campaigner but he also built lots of little tech projects that we still use
#xoxofest @anildash: there is a great site called folklore.org which sets out the history of the mac at apple
#xoxofest @anildash: we have to tell each other's stories - you don't have to use makerbase, write it on a cocktail napkin but tell it
#xoxofest @waxpancake: I thought Anil always started talks with a Prince song and ended with a Michael Jackson one but this was the 1st time
#xoxofest @waxpancake: the speakers we've had are absolutely stunning -give them a round of applause. I never see talks before they're given
#xoxofest @waxpancake: I love how our speakers make themselves vulnerable and honest
#xoxofest @waxpancake: our next speaker, I played her game Depression Quest and it was new and interesting
#xoxofest @waxpancake: after a year of harrasment, undeterred, she kept making new things to bring people into games
#xoxofest @waxpancake: gaming is the intersection of art and technology which requires great skill
#xoxofest @waxpancake: a huge round of applause for Zoë Quinn
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: I'm going to give you a lot of data, but I'm going to talk about some dark stuff too
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: If you live and work on line , this is about the way the internet is going
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: as far as I know, Crash Override is the only organisation that works with harrased people to unfuck their lives
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: every account that I had ever had anywhere was inundated with harassment, then hacked for people to target
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: The crappiest Baldwin, the human personification of your crazy uncle's mailing list gave it the name GamerGate
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: One of the GamerGaters got picked up on terrorist charges earlier today - not against me
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: I'm a game developer, I'm a systems thinker so I can see the patterns in behaviour
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: In highschool I was the nerdy kid who wore a trenchcoat that someone had to ask out when he lost a bet
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: I was in such a hurry to tell people in highschool that I wasn't like other girls - I was a "cool girls"
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: I used the term "attention whore" like telegrams used the word "stop"
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: if gamergate had happened several years ago and to someone else, I'd have been on the other side
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: I would have been one of those useful idiots who mkaes up hate mobs
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: Can we stop using the word Trolling it's Abuse. Trolling is a thing you can do to a friend, and still be friends
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: we end up playing a game of Schrödingers Murderer every time - is some hot topic kid or Dylan Roof?
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: Most people participating in online harassment think they're the good guys
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: they all have a secret conspiracy theory that you are secretly rich so they can still be the underdog 
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: There are a lot of things to be found in a mob, but justice isn't one of them
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: I talked to 300 former trollsand asked why they stopped, they said someone they looked up to said it wasn't cool
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: Another thing that got the trolls backing off is humanising the target, not making them a caricature
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: when my phone would ring, I'd answer it and they would say "Is this Zoë Quinn?" "yes" "oh. I'm sorry"
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: It's not really about the target, it's about belonging to the group that si attacking
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: If you look over to where the comments are on this video you'll see "she is evil! Boobs!" (I paraphrase)
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: More people would rather tell people that they had committed a misdemeanor than to mental health treatment
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: my biggest harassers use their real names and build a brand to raise money for attacking me
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: We need tech platforms to step up here, we should be ahead of this
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: don't get mad at the toddler who crashed your car, but the adult that gave them the keys
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: I've admitted to a lot today.You have a picture of me in fedora now, m'lady
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: consider if you are criticising someone's actions or shitting on someone as a person
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: No single snowflake feels responsible for the avalanche that crashes down on people
#xoxofest @TheQuinnspiracy: Don't be a snowflake in someone else's avalanche.
#xoxofest @waxpancake: Our final speaker of the day is an internationally reknowned expert in CSS and web standards, Eric Meyer
#xoxofest @meyerweb: I think Andy and Andy deserve a round of applause right now for all their work
#xoxofest @meyerweb: I started out on the web when it looked like this [screenshot of Mosaic browser]
#xoxofest @meyerweb: this was the days of gopher, which was like a BBS on steroids
#xoxofest @meyerweb: I wrote a tutorial on how to write HTML, and 4 million people learned from it, and I got no ad revenue for it
#xoxofest @meyerweb: when CSS came out I made a support grid for the 2 browsers that implemented it, and were very different
#xoxofest @meyerweb: back in the 1990s I started writing little notes on my homepage. We were bloggers once and young.
#xoxofest @meyerweb: I used to write the HTMl by hand, but then I got smart and used custom XML and handmade XSLTscript
#xoxofest @meyerweb: It was natural to me when my 5 year old daughter Rebecca was diagnosed with brain cancer, to write about it
#xoxofest @meyerweb: I wanted anyone who came by later to understand what they weer going through
#xoxofest @meyerweb: I kept up until I had to post her obituary 9 months later.
#xoxofest @meyerweb: My web developer friends got a hashtag trending #663399Becca on the day of her funeral
#xoxofest @meyerweb: There  was a proposal to add a colour to CSS calling #663399 "Becca Purple" - I said use RebeccaPurple
#xoxofest @meyerweb: there is now a memorial to my daughter in the CSS spec I work with all the time. I can't process this.
#xoxofest @meyerweb: What pushed me to think about RebeccaPurple again was gamergate that blew up into many attacks on women
#xoxofest @meyerweb: as a very part time gamer I felt like I was looking at this from the outside, and I stepped back to analyse it
#xoxofest @meyerweb: I saw I was seeing something very similar to the #663399Becca campaign here
#xoxofest @meyerweb: That same process was happening - a hashtag as a memetic hook as a way to organise a group to do something
#xoxofest @meyerweb: we can look at this in terms of the bad input, but it not just that. It is also the medium this happens in
#xoxofest @meyerweb: the medium is not neutral to it's uses - even a road is not neutral, as where it is built affects who uses it
#xoxofest @meyerweb: roads are not free-for-alls  - we set rules on how people use them and even license people to drive on them
#xoxofest @meyerweb: I am not advocating licensing people to use the internet, tempting as that would be sometimes
#xoxofest @meyerweb: what we do, what we value affects how the world works, how society changes over the next generations
#xoxofest @meyerweb: what our children see online is what they will think is normal
#xoxofest @meyerweb: software is eating the world, but we shape it. What we make easy shows what we value
#xoxofest @meyerweb: to paraphrase Brillat-Saverin: show me what you build and I will show you what you are
#xoxofest @meyerweb: League of Legends was known for having toxic communications - they tested the design to reduce this toxisicy
#xoxofest @meyerweb: The game ECO is a planetary simulator where players battle pollution adn extinction by an asteroid
#xoxofest @meyerweb: with our designs and with the things that we build there has not been much said about the values they encourage
#xoxofest @meyerweb: if we build networks where it is easy to harass, that is how it becomes the expected norm
#xoxofest @meyerweb: if networks make mounting those attacks more difficult, the ability to mute or block may be unnnecessary
#xoxofest @meyerweb: as there is no truly meaningful distinction between online and offline, the online behaviour will determine the offline
#xoxofest @meyerweb: we are building like crazy; we need to build wisely
#xoxofest @meyerweb: I ask you to do this not in Rebecca's name, but in the name of her brother and sister who will have to live with it
#xoxofest @waxpancake: the conference can get a little intense. Lets use the time between this talk and this evening to think about this.
