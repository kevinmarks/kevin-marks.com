<p>Indiewebcamp Dusseldorf happened last weekend <a class="auto-link" href="https://indiewebcamp.com/2016/D%C3%BCsseldorf">https://indiewebcamp.com/2016/D%C3%BCsseldorf</a> <a class="auto-link figure" href="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7043/26266222363_accec9b742_o.gif"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7043/26266222363_accec9b742_o.gif"/></a>
<p>Homebrew Website Club is based on the Homebrew Computer Club that happened in the 1970s and seeded the computer revolution
<p>a lot of people just use social media, but there are some of us who hack on our websites, so we do it for the web
<p>Indiewebcamp is more based on Barcamp - a structured conference over 2 days where the agenda is made by who arrives
<p>We start indiewebcamp with demos and discussions. The 2nd day is hack day, and we end with demos
<p>Indieweb summit is coming up in Portland <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/2016">http://indiewebcamp.com/2016</a> followed by the w3c SocialWG meeting
<p>Webmention is going to w3c Candidate recommendation

<p>I also made a custom parser to rescue <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/</a> into h-recipe

<p>it generates static html on mysite from scratch so it take longer and longer each time
<p>I have a lot of differnt posts types, waling reading and more - if I want to syndicate it uses <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a>
<p>it gets sent out to twitter and facebook, and I pull likes back too
<p>so now I cna go and backfill the indiewebcamp pages to say thsi supports them
<p>It's all static so I could theoretically host it on S3 or github, though it is on a page on my own site right now
<p>I like low contrast type in my code as I work on it late at night - my primary OS is this crazy LISP environment
<p>it's called Arcology- it's on my own git repository, not github
<p>I'm probably going to have to stop usingg emacs lisp as I have over 100M of files to translate into this

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Static sites are great and more and more common, but you can't set response codes for redirects or 410
<p>one thing we came up with for webmentions is to delete a comment using an http 410 Gone
<p>and then send a webmention to the original place that you sent the webmention so it can delete the comment
<p>to enable 410 for static sites, we could use a Meta http-equiv for the status header <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/meta_http-equiv_status">http://indiewebcamp.com/meta_http-equiv_status</a>
<p>I wrote this up as a spec on the indiewebcamp Wiki - you publish <meta http-equiv="Status" content="410 Gone"/>  in the head
<p>if you are serving the site, you should return this code. Similarly, if you receive this tag you should treat it as a 410
<p>I tweeted it at 5am this morning, and within an hour <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/tommorris">@tommorris</a> implemented it for Django
<p>Never underestimate the power of going to the beach.

<p>
<p>I use IFTTTT to take posts frome the various silos and make it a post on my wordpress site
<p>pocket, github, youtube, kickstarter and son on get fetched and posted ot my own site so I have a copy
<p>I can search across all of the things I have collected; I have pages and feeds for each topic

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://aribadernatal.com'>Ari Bader-Natal</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>after I built all this I showed my wife it and she said "isn't that Pinterest?"
<p>I use Amber, a wordpress plugin that makes a snapshot of sites you link to on your own site 
<p>I wrote a pst about using Amber to save links: <a class="auto-link" href="https://aribadernatal.com/2016/02/15/saving-favorites-amber-edition/">https://aribadernatal.com/2016/02/15/saving-favorites-amber-edition/</a>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>amber has a dashboard of every page it tries to index - whenever someone links form twitter it is a <a class="auto-link" href="http://t.co">t.co</a> link
<p>twitter robots.txt on <a class="auto-link" href="http://t.co/robots.txt">t.co/robots.txt</a> has User-agent: * Disallow: / so you can't spider links in tweets
<p>most sites I link to don't actually work to be archived for various different reasons
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>personal archives is broadly seen as a legitimate reason to ignore robots.txt—you aren't spidering, you're fetching as a user
