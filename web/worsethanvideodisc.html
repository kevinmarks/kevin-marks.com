        <p>Terence Eden has written a <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/09/writing-an-app-is-like-coding-for-laserdisc/">post</a> looking back on a claim by Jeremy Keith in 2011</p>
        <blockquote><p>11 years ago to the day, I was at a tech conference. It was 3 year after the iPhone had launched its app SDK. Those of us who had been in the mobile game a while had already spent years developing apps for Symbian, BlackBerry, Windows CE, and at least a dozen other OSes which I've since scrubbed from my memory.
<p>But apps were the hip "new" thing, apparently. And there were a lot of people who were passionately invested in the idea the Steve Jobs™️ would save us all.
<p>And, some of us, thought this was bunkum. With this memorable comparison being made:

11 years later, and I think Jeremy Keith (@adactio) was right.

<p>Now, I am old enough to have coded for LaserDiscs - I worked at the BBC Interactive Television Unit that had built the Domesday Project, and
     later at the MultiMedia Corporation that it became after spinning out from the BBC. I built museum installations that used multiple lasrdisc players to provide widescreen interactive TV. 
     I also worked on porting one of the BBC Laserdiscs to CD-ROM, and worked on CD-ROM native titles like 3D Atlas.</p>
     <p>The thing is, the Domesday project, and CD-ROMs, because they were standalone, can still be run through emulation. There is a <a href="https://domesday.computinghistory.org.uk/">full emulation available:</a></p>
     <img src="domesdayemu.png" />
     <p>Web pages are still available, and are archived by the Internet Archive as Terence says, but Videodics and CD-ROMs are too. 
        You can download an ISO image of <a href="https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Arts_3D_Atlas_Version_1.1_Macintosh_CRDM1244300_Electronic_Arts_1994">3D Atlas 1.1</a>, which I also worked on at MMC in 1993-4,
         and run it in an emulator. </p>
         <img src="3datlashome.png" width="640" />
         <img src="3datlasstats.png" width="640" />
    <p>They also have <a href="https://archive.org/details/apkarchive">Android</a> binaries too, which you may be able to run in emulation, if they're sufficiently standalone.
    <p>The standalone part is the rub - most iOS and Android apps are in effect specialised browsers that only work with a single site, and depend on server-side code to be running.
        A lot of websites do too, and the Internet Archive can't capture the server-side logic of these more complex sites, so they get added to the <a href="https://indieweb.org/site-deaths">Site Deaths</a> pile too.
    <p>Even sites where the server-side code is available can wind up undeployable as their dependencies vanish from npm or if they overbuilt using the React SPA worldview.</p>
    <p>If you want <a href="https://indieweb.org/longevity">longevity</a>, you need to code with it in mind and have a statically servable fallback. Which isn't a contradiction of what Terence and Jeremy are saying, but taking on board Alex's advice too.</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Upcoming conference talks have me once again thinking about the ways in which the frontend community has entirely lost the plot.<br><br>Until and unless you have hard data of long sessions with many &quot;fiddly&quot; interactions, your content should *not* be an &quot;SPA&quot; or JS-first. <a href="https://t.co/H5FCYNpfo4">https://t.co/H5FCYNpfo4</a></p>&mdash; Alex Russell (@slightlylate) <a href="https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1567184926038183938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <p class="p-summary">So Videodiscs aren't the worst things to archive, networks of servers running code that isn't available or archivable are, and we are building a lot more of those these days, whether on the web or in apps.</p>
