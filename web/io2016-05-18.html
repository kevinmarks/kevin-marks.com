<h2>Keynote - Sundar Pichai</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@sundarpichai'>sundarpichai</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we've been doing io for 10 years, there are 7000 of you here in person we are livestreaming to 530 extended events
<p>Over 1M people are tuning into the live stream from china
<p>when google was founded there were only 300M people online; now there are 3bn and people live on their phones
<p>today over 50% of our queries come from mobile phones; on android in the us  20% of queries are voice
<p>we no longer do 10 blue links, we do rich cards full of information on many topics
<p>if you search for hyperloop you get rich pages with AMP right in the search results
<p>we have been training our voice recognition deliberately with noise in the background to improve recognition
<p>we translate over 100 languages, with 140Bn words translated per day -we even do live visual transaltion
<p>today we are announcing the Google Assistant - we want to ask our users "hi, how can I help?"
<p>we want users to have an ongoing, 2-way dialogue with google, understanding you in the real world
<p>we already have elements of this working - those 20% of voice queries wiht OK google
<p>if you are in front of a landmark and ask "who designed this?" and google will know what you mean
<p>you can refer back to the results of a search with 'his' or it as part of a conversation
<p>we want to show you the kind of things we aspire to be able to do
<p>you should be able to ask google "what's playing tonight?" and get a list of 3, and say "we want to bring the kids"
<p>we think of the Google Assistant as an ambient experience that extends across multiple devices: phones, cars, rooms
<p>we have sold over 25M chromecast devices - we have been thinking about how to bring this to the home
<p>credit to Amazon for creating excitement in thsi space, we'll launch something later this year
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@marioqueiroz'>Mario Queiroz</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We're creating Google Home, which will launch later this year. and will use speech primarily
<p>we have lots of experience in far field voice recognition, and expect this to work bet
<p>we will have a lot of different stylings to match your decor, as it has no buttons just a microphone and speakers
<p>not long ago we introduced chromecast to play movies and videos on the biggest screen in your house, 
<p>google home is a wifi speaker that streams directly from the cloud to a single speaker [so mono?]
<p>Google Cast allows you to control other speakers in the house without complications by saying which one to use
<p>it lets you control your video content too - just tell google home and it will appear on the biggest screen
<p>as well as to do lists and shopping lists, we will integrate with your smart home devices, including Nest
<p>Google home lets you Ask Google about anything - it builds on 17 years of experience in search
<p>you can ask "what was the US population when NASA was established?" and it will know
<p>Google Home will also get to know you and your packages deliveries and trips [the whole family?]
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href=''>Google Home</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>"turn the lights on in Kevin's room" [no scope for abuse there then]
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@sundarpichai'>sundarpichai</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Thanks to advances in computer vision we approached Photos from a new perspective
<p>Google Photos has over 200M monthly active users - we have applied over 2 Trillion labels
<p>24B of those labels are for selfies -we even have Pomeranian selfies
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikkay'>Erik Kay</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We have a new messaging app called "Allo" - it learns over time to make conversations better
<p>Allo is based on your phone number, so it integrates wiht your address book [gah, why would you do that? ]
<p>we have a great selection of stickers and emoji; but we added whisper/shout - slide send button up and dow to change size
<p>no more yelling in all caps to get your point across.
<p>we have "ink" to let you scribble on photos [this is dads learning to snapchat, isn't it]
<p>we have suggested smart replies based on machine learning - Allo will suggest based on how you express yourself
<p>smart replies contain stickers adn emojis too - as they say an emoji is worth 1000 words. do they say that?
<p>Allo offers smart replies when someone sends a photo [suggests 'cute dog']
<p>we can tell the breed of a dog and whether it is cute or not to suggest this [you're objectifying dogs with AI?]
<p>we can recognise the linguine and clams in this pasta dish
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href=''>Rebecca</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm going to show you how the assistant in Allo can help Amit and Joy [Rebecca doesn't get a surname or Name super]
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://plus.google.com/+RebeccaMichael'>Rebecca Michael</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the Assistant can converse with Amit about restaurants, book on open table, and stay in the group
<p>just like any other conversation, google assistant picks up where you left off
<p>you can ask "did my team win?" and the assistant will tell you Real Madrid's latest score 
<p>it will show the team roster, and if Amit clicks on Ronaldo it show shim
<p>if he then says "best tricks" it shows a youtube of Ronaldo's best tricks
<p>theres a 'guess the movie from the emoji' game built in Allo, but we expect devs to do better [implict API promise]
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikkay'>Erik Kay</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Lets talk about privacy and security. sometimes people want to be incognito - there is an Incognito mode in Allo
<p>while all messages are encrypted in Allo, incognito is end to end encrypted and you can set expiry time
<p>Allo will be the first home for the Google Assistant
<p>Allo is all about messaging, but Video Calling is great too
<p>why don't we do video calling more often? [we do, but we do it in Facebook Messenger mate]
<p>I'd like to introduce you to Duo, a simple video calling companion to Allo - it works on both Android and iOS
<p>Duo has 'knock knock' you see a live video of the caller before you even pick up, and seamless joins the call
<p>Here's a call from my daughter Eva - I use her for all my demos (shows daughter waving for a minute before answering)
<p>Duo is built by the team that created WebRTC, the open technology that powers video chat
<p>we use a new protocol called 'Quick' that optimises use of codecs and lag on WebRTC
<p>Duo proactively monitors network quality multiple times a minute, and will switch quality or even cell to wifi automatically
<p>Both Allo and Duo will be available this summer on iOS and Android [not laptops?]

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@davey_burke'>Dave Burke</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>it has been 10 years since we started working on Android - it's the most popular OS in the world
<p>Android Wear now has 12 partner brands with watchmakers like Tag Heuer [no sales figures?]
<p>There were 65Bn installs from Google Play in the last year alone
<p>we released early previews on the N release before I/O this time - the response has been overwhelming
<p>go to <a class="auto-link" href="http://android.com/n">android.com/n</a> and suggest names to us, but please don't call it Namey McNameface
<p>In Android N, Vulkan is a modern 3D graphic API, that is more efficient than OpenGL
<p>The compiler in N is much faster, and the JIT means app installs can be 75% faster, and saves app space by up to 50%
<p>Android has a multilayered defense in depth security model. N introduces file based encryption, not just block based
<p>we learned last year the importance of hardening the media framework - we separated out the codecs and components
<p>N updates the system software without you having to do anything. Like Chrome it has 2 system images at any time
<p>and the pesky 'Android is updating' dialog is gone thanks to the JIT
<p>the best feeling in software is deleting code like that
<p>Google Chrome protects users by warning before they go to a site that has malware or deceptive
<p>Google Play Store puts apps through rigorous security testing before deploying
<p>we have an App Security Improvement Program to teach Banks how to use https properly
<p>We have SafetyNet to delete apps that misbehave  - we check 8Bn apps/day
<p>we learned from user research that people normally switch between the last 7 apps in the list, so we delete old ones
<p>if you double tap the recents button it swaps back to the last app you were in
<p>we have 2 new window modes  - split screen and picture in picture
<p>I can log-tap on the recents button and put a secondapp up
<p>say I'm watching a live tv program - I can put the content into picture in picture and swap apps to search
<p>we added a quick reply mode to messaging notifications without launching the app
<p>Android is the first mobile platform to support Unicode 9 emoji standards [so you can facepalm 🤦]
<p>Android N is the best android so far. I have to say that, but it is actually true.
<p>go to <a class="auto-link" href="http://android.com/beta">android.com/beta</a> to install N on your main device when it is ready

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.claybavor.com/'>Clay Bavor</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Virtual reality is coming to Android N - it started with Cardboard 2 years ago, and are now 50M cardboard apps
<p>Cardboard was a start, but there is a limit to what you can do with phones not designed for VR
<p>to make VR comfortable you need to minimise motion to photon latency
<p>what we've built won't be available until this fall, We call it Daydream - it enables VR on Android
<p>in Daydream there are smartphones, a headset and controller, and apps designed for this
<p>we have made a set of specifications for conformance to Daydream VR specs and latency requirements
<p>We have introduced VR mode in Android N - latency down to under 20ms; and VR system UI so alerts come through
<p>Daydream is part of the core of Android N, and there will be a lot of phones available with it this fall
<p>VR headsets have to have great optics and be comfortable on you head. We made a reference design for this
<p>the controller is just as important as the headset for VR- it has 2 buttons and an orientationsensor
<p>(shows video of someone waving their hand around and 3d things following it) [I miss datagloves]
<p>We have built Google Play for VR - users can search, buy and install apps in VR
<p>(shows screen full of partner logos and promise great things to come)
<p>we have rebuilt YouTube from the ground up for VR - 3D audio, immersive video and a VR mode for standard videos too
<p>Daydream arrives this fall, but you can start developing fro it today with the latest Android N preview

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://blog.davidsingleton.org/'>David Singleton</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>with Android Wear we have over 100 distinctive designs of watches - it works with Android and iPhones
<p>I'm showing a preview of Android Wear 2.0 - we learned a lot over the last 2 years
<p>the most important role of your watch is staying connected to what matters with timely information
<p>Now any watchface can show data from any app
<p>here's a watchface customised with info from different apps - clicking them goes right throgh to the app
<p>we now have smart reply, best in class handwriting recognition and a new keyboard
<p>Google Fit has automatic activity recognition that you can move information between apps
<p>now you don't even need a phone to combine with the watch - sending messages and streaming music can be standalone
<p>your android wear apps can be standalone; they can have direct access to the cloud  without a phone connected
<p>there is a preview of Android wear 2.0 today for developers to download
<p>(shows video of an app developed for Syrian refugees in Turkey)

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@jasontitus'>Jason Titus</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the shift to mobile for the web platform is well underway -over 1Bn mobile chrome users per month
<p>we have powerful new web standards in Chrome to make app-like web apps - Progressive Web Apps
<p>We created the open source Accelerated Mobile Pages to build on web standards to be very fast
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://plus.google.com/101506539541311096638'>Steph Cuthbertson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>this morning we release Android Studio 2.2 preview - when you  hit Run we deploy changes directly.
<p>the emulators are now 3x faster, and may eb faster than the physical device in your pocket
<p>we make it easier to write tests- with test recording we write Espresso code for you
<p>you can run the tests locally or on our cloud integrated test base for other devices
<p>Layout Designer now has automated constraints for you, but without the need for nested layouts improving performance
<p>we have an APK analyzer and a layout inspector to help you work out how your app behaves
<p>we have been steadily building out C++ support   - as well as gradle we now support cmake and ndk build
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://g.co/androidstudio">g.co/androidstudio</a> - get it now and send us feedback

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@jasontitus'>Jason Titus</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>18 months ago we acquired Firebase - since then it has grown to have 450,000 developers
<p>Firebase analytics works across android and IOS and is free and unlimited
<p>if an ad crashes it's bad for your users, so we integrated crash reporting in firebase
<p>with dynamic links NPR was able to take 13 taps down to 4
<p>with Crash reporting you can see crashes as they are happening, and then notify users when you have a fix
<p>Firebase is available today at <a class="auto-link" href="http://firebase.google.com">firebase.google.com</a> and we'll talk more this afternoon

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://play.google.com'>Ellie Powers</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm going to show you a sneak peek of a new way to experience android apps
<p>we want to make it easier for users and developers to connect
<p>with the web you can just click on a link and get to any web page. what if you could run an app wiht one tap?
<p>with Android Instant Apps you can run an app instantly without installation
<p>my friend sends a link to buzzfeed video url; it goes stright to the buzzfeed android app and loads just the bits neede
<p>this is a real android app - it has been split into modules, so it downloaded only the module for this screen
<p>B&H Photo have a great android app I don't have installed. from search I can be in this app on my phone
<p>I walk up to a parking meter, tap my phone and it brings up the parking meter app immediately
<p>for the user it is totally seamless. As a developer, it's the same android APIs, but you modualarize your app for this
<p>the demo Ficus did was on a phone running KitKat - Instant Apps will work all the way back to Jellybean
<p>we are gradually rolling out access to developers for Instant Apps
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@sundarpichai'>sundarpichai</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Firebase is the most comprehensive developer offering we have done to date
<p>We are opening up core components of our machine learning systems. tensorflow was open sourced last year
<p>last week we open sourced a natural language parser to extend Tensorflow
<p>we have computer vision, speech and machine learnign APIs in google cloud now as well
<p>by using the cloud machine learning APIs, you get access to the custom hardware we have built for machine learning
<p>These Tensor Processing Units  - TPUs are faster and better per watt than any graphics card used for AI now
<p>Move 37 by AlphaGo was widely seen as a very creative Go move, which is a new milestone in AI
<p>here is an example of robots picking up real objects using deep learning
<p>the robot nudges the stapler away to pick up the yellow object - not a coded rule but learned
<p>Diabetic Retinopathy is the largest cause of blindness. You need to scan the eye and have a doctor identify symptoms

<h2>What's New in Android N?</h2>

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://chetchat.blogspot.com'>Chet Haase</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We're going to talk about Android N preview 3 today [which my phone just offered to download]
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.curious-creature.com'>Romain Guy</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We designed the constraint based layout in conjunction with Android studio - we run the constraint code at 60fps
<p>when you add a button to a guide position, it autocreates constraints for you. Constraint code works back to Gingerbread
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://chetchat.blogspot.com'>Chet Haase</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>one of the more visible changes in N is multiwindow - long press on recents to split them
<p>how split-screen works out of the box is based on the magic of android layouts - your app simply works
<p>you are opted in by default, but you can opt out of it and specify minimum sizes
<p>Picture in Picture mode is the other multiscreen model
<p>Drag and Drop has been in Android for a while, but with multiscreen it makes a lot more sense, so try it out
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@dansandler'>Dan Sandler</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Notifications now have new templates for the first time since honeycomb [why are they so low contrast?]
<p>we have bundled notifications for multiples, and we also have direct reply - respond without opening the app
<p>we now have quick settings, and the 5 top quick setting appear inline with notifications. 
<p>Display size is a new setting replaces the font size accessibility. The SP part of font size didn't work well
<p>the new Display Size setting changes the dpi size of the device at runtime - .85x to 1.45x to scale it at a lower level
<p>do ensure your app works in sw320dp - if the user changes the density this will make you app need to cope
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://chetchat.blogspot.com'>Chet Haase</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Multi-Locale - outside of my country people speak more than one language [you don't know many Hispanic-Americans Chet?]
<p>the User can now select multiple languages and order them, so they get localised apps when they exist
<p>Doze mode on android M kicks in after a while, then it wakes up every so often, interval decaying exponentially
<p>In N Doze mode you don't have to be stationary to trigger doze mode; apparently some people walk without using phones
<p>we found that lots of apps were listening for network activity changes, and thrashing as you walk around wifi
<p>we also got rid of the new photo and video actions
<p>instead use the jobscheduler to find out about photos rather than thrashing every app on the phone
<p>Data Saver now lets you restrict network access by app to stop apps costing  you money
<p>there is a new api to find metered networks and for knowing when you have been restricted
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.curious-creature.com'>Romain Guy</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Direct Boot now boots until lockscreen until you enter pin code, so you don;t have to unlock to run apps
<p>Up until now you had to ask permission for the entire storage -now you can use Scoped Directory for specific ones
<p>You can now easily turn off apps that are in Work mode so you can take the weekend off
<p>you can also have a Work challenge for authenticating into Work apps that applies across them
<p>The new Runtime has a faster interpreter, a JIT and compilation ahead of time - lots fo ways it is sped up
<p>we have new ICU4J unicode and globalization support that means you don't need external libs for this 
<p>If you want lambdas in Java, we support those back to Gingerbread but you have to use the Jack compiler with Java 8
<p>we have reduced autio latency in the lower levels - AudioTrack reduces latency 40-70ms
<p>you have to set a flag AudioAttributes.FLAGLOWLATENCY to get low latency audio in your app
<p>Switch to Clang, GCC is deprecated
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://chetchat.blogspot.com'>Chet Haase</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>VR has a new setVRModeEnabled Activity - do not turn this on if you are not making a full VR app
<p>Support Library 23.2 adds Night Mode, Bottom Sheets, and VectorDrawable - use this for smaller apps
<p>VectorDrawable performance is 20%-90% faster now in both drawing and parsing.
