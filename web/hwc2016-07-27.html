<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>welcome to Homebrew Website Club at Mozilla - you can always check when it is at <a class="auto-link" href="https://indieweb.org/next-hwc">https://indieweb.org/next-hwc</a>
<p>Nuremberg has a Homebrew Website club on the alternate weeks from us
<p>August 27-28 we have an Indiewebcamp New York City - the 2nd this year. Hopefully there won't be a blizzard this time.
<p>London and Brighton both had Homebrew Website Clubs earlier today - Göteborg is on summer break
<p>I added a minor thing on my website - I did my first bookmark post <a class="auto-link" href="http://tantek.com/2016/209/t2/sf-webpeople-personalsites-indieweb">http://tantek.com/2016/209/t2/sf-webpeople-personalsites-indieweb</a> with book mark emoji
<p>because I linked to Indienews <a class="auto-link" href="https://news.indieweb.org/en">https://news.indieweb.org/en</a> - the post shows up on Indienews, the indie hacker news
<p>it shows up because I sent a webmention to indienews - webmention is general and different sites can interpret the meaning
<p>indienews is decentralized hacker news

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://upon2020.com/'>Johannes Ernst</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have been making my own linux distro UBOS  meant to make sysadmin easier for you
<p>so for example it take s a single commmand to install <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a> - and a single command to update the whole thing
<p>I now have mattermost which is an open source slack implementation you can install
<p>we also have wordpress with the indieweb plugins and mediawiki
<p>we also have one-click offsite encrypted back up - it will zip up the whole server and put it on amazon s3
<p>so you can run one command on raspberry pi and one on amazon and move your entire server.
<p>it can now set up a website and get an ssl cert in one go
<p>there is an Amazon ec2 image and a virtualbox image if you want to try it

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://commongarden.org'>Jake Hartnell</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Jake and my site is <a class="auto-link" href="http://commongarden.org">http://commongarden.org</a>
<p>I'm really intersted in giving people more control over IoT
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://commongarden.org">http://commongarden.org</a> is about giving people more control over agriculture 
<p>set up your own IoT server that lets you set up control over watering, lighting and pH for growing
<p>we started a project called GrowIoT -so you have  control
<p> there is a bunch of bullshit out there that makes you go through their servers every time, we want you to control
<p>there is a Tessel 2 board designed to make this easier 
<p>GrowIoT is a meteor app at the moment, based on w3c's Web of things framework, using JSON representations
<p>the idea is to have a general UI and see data streaming in and put data into a database you own

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://commongarden.org'>Jake Hartnell</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we're working with companies who are growing things like algae - they want their own data sets
<p>I'm growing a redwood tree in hydroponics - when they start out they are really tiny
<p>actually, a tree is a really good investment - if you start from seeds trees double in price every 2 years
<p>it's not as simple as just turning things on and off - hysteresis is a big thing here

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://withknown.com'>Known</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p><a class="auto-link" href="http://teach.kqed.org/">http://teach.kqed.org/</a> is a community space powered by Known, and there are more coming
<p>the way you pass courses is by posting on a social network, and comments are all indieweb
<p>Known is good for groups of people who either need to publish publicly or privately
<p>there is a lot of value in building communities, and it's not in opposition t people having their own sites
<p>also Known is hiring a PHP developer - so if you want to build communities on known contact us
