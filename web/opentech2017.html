<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bit.ly/6QZYd'>Hadley Beeman</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we assume that the net is dumb pipes and the smart stuff happens at the edges, but too often sites know you
<p>you can be cookied, supercookied, browser fingerprinted and have your IP address tracked
<p>we have some mitigations - Do Not Track headers, cookie masking, selectively disabling sites, ultimately TOR
<p>but all the browsers have different versions of private browsing - Chrome has incognito and guest, ff has private
<p>all of these do different thing. Chrome's incognito and guest modes wipe cookies on close, and separate permission
<p>firefox private browsing doesn't create cookies
<p>Safari won't update cookies, and stops recent searches being saved, 
<p>Brave, when shields are up, protects against fingerprinting by blocking machine specific apis
<p>IE/Edge will block cookies and also prevent 1 pixel gif tracking and blocks some ad networks
<p>the good news is that browsers compete to improve private browsing,
<p>the bad news is that its hard for users to remember which privacy features are in which browser
<p>I worry that users will find it unclear what they are protected from, adn we shoudl standadrise more here
<p>duckduckgo surveyed people about privacy, and they most wanted protection from embarrassing searches
<p>safari is the only private browsing tool that says it hides recent searches in private mode
<p>all the different specs for the different parts of the web interrelate - we have had 2 groups ask TAG for private
<p>
<p>presentation API want the fullscreen mode toe change in private mode, and payments API wants to change in private
<p>but there isn't a spec for private mode, so the apis can't describe how to interact with it
<p>Conclusion: we need more data - more UX research to design interfaces so users are informed and safe
<p>we need to know how this will interact with other parts of the web - once we define private mode, more will use it

<p>doteveryone is a think tank that focuses on fairness
<p>"fighting for a fairer internet" is godd simple and slightly meaningless slogan that I want to see everywhere
<p>the web was meant to be a big open space that brought us all together, but it is affected by economics
<p>we want to take the web experience out of the black box so that people have a clearer view of what is happening
<p>As the parent of a 4-year-old I hear a lot of "it's not fair" so fairness can sound like a whinge
<p>we're not only voters or workers or learners, we are in many roles at once
<p>I've been in technology for 20 years, and there is still lots of it I don't understand
<p>the problem with the optimism of "this is for everyone" is that everyone has different values 
<p>it's been too easy to ignore people whose values aren't the same as those making the web
<p>If you're a government your values and norms are within your country, but a corporate norm can be global
<p>if we don't have shared values, rather than respecting laws and values of nations we have corporate laws
<p>Denmark appointed an ambassador to Silicon Valley to negotiate with the companies there
<p>these are the 9 men who write the facebook timeline algorithm - they have more power than lots of legislators
<p>there aren't good ways of opting out an challenging this, and even if you do opt out it carries on for others
<p>there aren't that many ways of making money on the net - advertising only has so much time and clicks to sell
<p>capitalism isn't the same thing as democracy - they have different incentives
<p>there are more people using facebook every month than live in the biggest country in the world
<p>anyone can have a point of view, it's harder to make people hear it and respond
<p>we want to make it easier for everyone to understand the internet
<p>we want to make it easier to know that a technology is responsible and good
<p>and we need to stimulate and encourage new value models than just capital
<p>For digital understanding we believe knowledge is power - we want to encourage critical thinking
<p>We are defining a "fair trade" mark equivalent for tech so people can know its responsible
<p>We have an Ethical Tech initiative directory
<p>we want to lead by example with ethical technology
<p>the person who digitises an organisation is often quite heroic, and need support

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://anna.ps'>Anna Powell-Smith</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Anna and I'm talking about mapping land ownership with private eye
<p>this was a private eye special report into ownership of land and property in the uk by tax havens and companie
<p>it's also a map at <a class="auto-link" href="http://private-eye.co.uk/registry">private-eye.co.uk/registry</a> which I built - I'm not a journalist, I'm an engineer
<p>it will show you properties nearby owned by companies in tax havens eg 99 Malet street is owned by a co in Virgin Is
<p>you can't search the registry by name
<p>the crown and church have been selling off land to foreign entities in tax havens
<p>the Trocadero, which well know and hate, is owned by a company lined with the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe
<p>2/3 of the companies found are offshore
<p>we have polygons for freeholds and poitns for leaseholds on the map
<p>people use offshore accounts to avoid tax - Capital gains used to be exempt, inheritance still is
<p>the otehr reason is secrecy - to mask the actual ownership
<p>Colonel Gadhaffi's son owns a nice house in highgate for example
<p>the pernicious thing is that this has become normalised so people aren't even suprised by it any more
<p>the Eye made a FoI request for land traded by foreign companies betwene 2004 and 2014
<p>theys ent the info, then said "we shouldn't have released that, give it back" so we didn't
<p>the land registry will turn a titl ID into a pdf for 3 quid, but that would be too much
<p>so we scraped the land registry database, and joined that with INSPIRE land ownership polygons
<p>INSPIRE is polygons, and each one has an ID - it is published as part of an EU directive in 2005 for environment
<p>they released the minimum they could - just the freehold polygons and with a useless ID
<p>you can download this, but you don't have a license to reuse it, so can't publish is
<p>Christian paid the land registry to join INSPIRE IDs to title IDs at 2p a reord
<p>the leaseholds we don't have polygons se we use points for them
<p>we use fair dealing as to publish parts of INSPIRE as they are small excerpts for public interest
<p>the Land Registry emailed me asking how we did this
<p>the Eye said they were going to publish this; the day before the land registry published their own version
<p>but they only published a snapshot, not ongoing status
<p>the government than said they would publish ownership by UK companies as well as overseas ones but not Uk trusts
<p>London has been an attractive place to hide money from overseas through these comanies
<p>this would no longer be possible
<p>now the land registry reject FOI requests as they are "reasonably" available (for £60m)
<p>they will no longer sell title ID to INSPIRE lookups, so you have to pay £3 per property
<p>the land registry has said they will release the addresses and company names - I want them to add INSPIRE IDs too
<p>Ordnance Survey are legally required to make money from their data, would be better to fund from tax or land fees
<p>we need a jolly serious economist to write a report about why this is harmful, to change OS rules anna@anna.ps

<p>Local authorities have registries of what they own, encourage them to publish maps as well
<p>there is a blog called "who owns england" <a class="auto-link" href="https://whoownsengland.org/">https://whoownsengland.org/</a> that follows this
<p>INSPIRE Ids are polygons and a title can have several, but they are mainly to obscure it

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/'>John Sheridan</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm the Digital Director of the National Archives - we preserve information and provide access to it
<p>if it's a physical archive, we put the box of papers on the shelf and have a reading room for you to see them
<p>we also try to provide context for what the archived records mean
<p>the records of the Alan Turing trial at the time would be viewed as a record of guilt and deviance
<p>now the Turing trial records are seen as a record of state homophobia - the context changed
<p>there are archives that hold evidence of significant human rights abuses, and people have tried to destroy them
<p>our archives have historically been physical, but now we are increasingly digitising them
<p>there is no long term form for storing data - digital preservation is hard compared to paper
<p>hard disks last about 5 years; tape is bout 20 years, so you are relentlessly copying your records and checking
<p>you need to understand what it is that you have so that you can produce the record when you need it
<p>with physical this is easy; digitally you have to have code to make the data viewable as well
<p>a digital archive needs to know what code it has to run to show the records in the data
<p>Information that is encoded in an open standard format is easier to preserve, and more likely to remain usable
<p>open standards both tend to have multiple implementations and document the form of the data for more in future
<p>open source helps too by making the code able to be run without buying thousands of variations of licences
<p>we don't have an equivalent for depositing copies of software, so open source software is a big advanttage
<p>open source software that implements open standards for data formats is especially useful
<p>Open data matters too - each document often depends on other data too - so they have dependencies on others
<p>The British Library has a huge archive of websites; we have one of government sites which we can publish
<p>the BL doesn't think it can publish this archive, as it doesn't have rights to ti
<p>use of information is one of the best guarantors of continuing to make the data available in future
<p>open standards, open source and open data all matter, and so does transparency of institutions
<p>we are moving form being an organisation that provides a single repository to one that mitigates decay risk
<p>what can we do beyond just keeping the 0's and 1's ? memory institutions have to make decisions on these
<p>Memory institutions publishing hashes of records we have today, particularly closed ones
<p>that will make it clear that records have not been tampered with between being archived and being made available
<p>I want to stress the importance of the decisions being made now about what data is kept by archives
<p>open standards, open source and open data all matter for archives, as does transparency of these decisions

<p>So many people are excited by tech for good right now 5400 members in London, Techfugees 60o0 members
<p>and then ether are things like code club that help people learn to code
<p>the best tech story is that the government digital service did exist at all
<p>the GDS getting 350,000 more organ donors by adding a link to <a class="auto-link" href="http://gov.uk">gov.uk</a>
<p>here's a picture of VDLA from the air - you can see the truck bays that used to have trucks full of paper in
<p>GDS is like any other religion, they have a period out in the cold, but liek all good religions they left a book behind
<p>the <a class="auto-link" href="http://gov.uk">gov.uk</a> service manual is that book - <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">https://www.gov.uk/service-manual</a> it is stunningly helpful

<p>Do we work with what we have got, or do we fight?
<p>I have had an Echo for 6 months, and other people's houses now feel broken
<p>a house that doesn't listen to you will become a house with no water or electricty

<p>if you google for suicide, they inject links to get you to phone the samaritans

<p>this is a beautiful public interest tech idea

<p>the reward here is people don't die, the case is rare enough
<p>What wouldn't be better delivered natively by GAFA? They can integrate important things
<p>GAFA have access to permissions that nobody else has
<p>is the public interest tech future to be back end suppliers to GAFA?
<p>If so, how do we a) talk to them b) pay for this c) build any reputation?
<p>everyone should spend a lot of time talking to democracy club -they did work out how to get things into google's homepage

<p>Ada Lovelace Day is an international celebration of the achievements of women in Science Technology Engineering and Maths
<p>we started out signing people up to blog about women in technology on the sadly defunct PledgeBank
<p>blogging has fallen out of fashion these days, and the event has evolved to be more about events
<p>we have a STEM cabaret each October in London
<p>we've had talks about Why We Laugh, How to Build a Comet and much more
<p>this is the 10th of October and come along
<p>people have started organising Ada Lovelace Day events around the world - Hackathons, Pub Quizzes, even a Cream Tea
<p>We have published two books "A passion for Science" about women in science
<p>we have also produced some great careers posters for schools that do very well
<p>last year we launched a podcast about women in STEM, where we talk to women about their work 
<p>we also tell the story of historic women in tech
<p>we have lots of resources and information at <a class="auto-link" href="http://findingada.com/">http://findingada.com/</a>
<p>there are very few inspirational dolls for young girls, so we have crochet patterns for women in STEM <a class="auto-link" href="http://findingada.com/crochet/">http://findingada.com/crochet/</a>
<p>we are looking at inspirational figures and finding ways to make your own dolls of women in STEM, because Mattell won't
<p>There are so many things to deal with as a woman in STEM, so we need role models
<p>We know that if a role model takes on too many stereotypes at once, it backfires
<p>we're doing a big report on role models coming out in the autumn
<p>We are looking at an online recruitment fair for women in STEM which we will run in November
<p>we have shortages in certain skill sets, and we can't afford to let 50% of the workforce go to waste
<p>Men are less likely to have a job directly after graduation than women, but women are more likely to get low quality jobs
<p>we're not connecting women with the higher quality jobs
<p>also, part fo the gender pay gap is that women are getting stuck with the lower quality jobs
<p>women don't apply for a job if they don't meet all the criteria; men will wing it with 60% of the criteria
<p>there is an issue with the language used to discuss STEM in the recruitment ads - gendered language predicts gender of hire
<p>tech jobs are biased toward masculine language, and hence masculine hires
<p>machine intelligence adverts are the most gendered ads
<p>it's not just about connecitng, it's also about teaching firms how to talk to women
<p>interest in salary saturates - they look for training, and opportunities for promotion and social worth
<p>when you look at the gender split in STEM subjects - Medicine is 70% women, Vets are 77% women - Strong social worth
<p>we need people to talk about their companies ethical values as well to attract women
<p>while it is true that people can move from city to city, women are far less likely to want to move away
<p>women are more likely to have domestic care duties, or be a trailing spouse
<p>we need to do a better job of talking to women and graduates in general about how to cope with moving to a new town
<p>what worked for recruiting Gen Xers isn't working for recruiting Milennials
<p>We're always looking or new sponsors, if you might be interested

<p>individuals report that they are happier when visiting places that are more scenic
<p>what makes a place more beautiful? is there a collective understanding more than just natural is beautiful

<p>I work for the ODI, and I care bout the Open Data dream
<p>in our perfect open data future society recognises that data is infrastructure
<p>datasets that are useful for the future of the country will be funded, and addresses will be free
<p>if you look at roads, they are used by everyone for multiple purposes - data should be like that
<p>citizens, businesses, charities and governments can collaborate on strong reliable and useful data
<p>Data should be taught. Not just using it but understanding the power of data. we need a litearture of data too
<p>data should not just be the province of data scientists, but something everyone can do something with
<p>Data is used. People should be able to use data to make decisions and create understanding
<p>We need to trust in data for it to eb sued well.
<p>Data must be used ethically. We have discussions around how to use it, and listen to each other. Data creates trust.
<p>Data is used by everyone, it is used in consultation, we talk about it and use it, and discuss what it right and good.
<p>that dream is strong data infrastructure, skills at every level of society, we have trust in ethics and integrity of data
<p>This is the Republic numerique bill from France, saying that certain data is so important the state should fund it
<p>Citymapper is a good example - public data being innovated over by a private company making it more useful
<p>Godan is the global open data in agriculture and nutrition initiative - another community built on open data
<p>Godan people care about agriculture and nutrition, and open data is a means to achieve progress
<p>Open Street Map is gathering data form individual and also from companies, and sharing it back too
<p>OpenActive is a project at ODI to encourage people doing activities to share data to build up infrastructure
<p>We're starting to have the conversations with normal non data people - Co-op has an event on Friday on trust+transaprency
<p>I want to talk about avoiding  traps next
<p>avoid complacency - we thought the argument was won in the UK, but we need to keep making the case
<p>be careful of Open Washing - the Open Banking standard is not under a good licence - it is revocable and limited
<p>if we let our standards slip we don't get the benefits of true openness
<p>Failure to adapt is a big issue - we need to change our message to get round brick walls.
<p>we need to talk about the data economy and friction freee flows
<p>Giving up is a danger - you sometimes need to keep on banging against the brick wall
