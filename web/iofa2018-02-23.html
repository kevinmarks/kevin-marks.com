Keeping track of everything in trade is a huge problem, and is still mostly done through paper documents
<p>Anyone who has done anything with an invoice finds that everyone involved has a differerent number for the invoice
<p>Blockchain has the potential to keep track of all this information in an accountable and public way, that can combine payment with a register of ownership
<p>We're moving into a new economic phase with more focus on regionalism than globalisation - being able to verify compliance with regulations automatically could be Globalisation 2.0

<p>Trade is the negotiation of reciprocal promises that are enforceable - that is a legal definition of contract, but it is what trade is at heart
<p>Negotiation was originally in person or local; technology make it work over longer distances. 
<p>Reciprocal promise means that I will do somethign for you, if you do something for me. 
<p>Enforceable means that if you do not fulfil your promise, you are required to compensate me.
<p>I'd like to put blockchain technology in this historical context of contract agreement. IT has helped automate the negotation of promises, and the settlement, but maybe less impact on enforcement.
<p>So what is new about Blockchain? How does it change what can co right and wrong with trade?

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/Clive Freedman'>Clive Freedman</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Putting your contracts on the blockchain would mean that software could act on a trigger for you.
<p>The difficulty is that a judge can't read the software and decide what you have agreed. Commenting the code may not be enough to clarify this.
<p>a more useful way would be for an expert to explain the details of the smart contract. What may make more sense is a parallel human readable contract to accompany the smart one
<p>this will enable the setting of arbitration terms, venu and country of law
<p>fact A causing action B to occur can go wrong in several ways - fact A may not be detected; action B may not occur because the computer may be offline
<p>Now many of these things can happen without blockchains or smart contracts - look at margin calls for example
<p>or look at investors being able to buy invoices from retailers to spread their rick
<p>there is likely to be a 20-30 page contarct drawn up by lawyers to specify how disputes are resolved in these situations
<p>If we're over-reliant on the smart contracts without the accompanying natural language contracts in place, thinsg may go wrong
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.andersonkill.com/'>Stephen Palley</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Everything has changed and nothing has changed. Look at the example of a Letter of Credit. - what if the bank behind the letter of credit is no longer solvent?
<p>The notion of guaranteed enforceability is attractive - you can get a  judgement without being able to collect it; maybe blockchain can change this
<p>Contract law itself was an important technological innovation - changing from self help to state power. Can blockchain take enforcement away from state power?
<p>I was asked recently if Insurance covers a deal made on a blockchain - I had to explain fork risk
<p>how much was frozen in parity? $100M ? Its only a matter of time before sums like that end up in front of a judge?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href=''>Adam Sanitt</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>The problem with international trade is that you are separated by space and time. We try to replace physical exchange with letter of credit or bills of lading
<p>Blockchain lets you do this exchange digitally, and keeps a record of the transaaction
<p>I think of reality mismatch errors - the blockchain is correct in what it records but reality is at fault. We can't avoid reality mismatches
<p>another reality mismatch can be a transfer made in error or with a gun to your head. The courts will reverse these errors
<p>when contracts were written down people thought we would no longer need lawyers to handle them. The same will happen with smart contarcts

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://mattereum.com'>Chris Wray</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>there is an idea of Ricardian contracts  - a piece of software that enforces a contract but comes with a written legal agreement that covers it too

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.andersonkill.com/'>Stephen Palley</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>a couple of years ago you would see that "code eats law"  or "code is law" - contracts are an artefact of trade. 
<p>if you could create system that removed any possibility of a a disagreement that may be a problem too. Sometimes you want ambiguity in an agreement.
<p>there is a difference between an agreement and a contract and a dispute - contracts assume enforcement is there.
<p>The point of courts is to have a neutral arbiter deicide how to resolve the agreement

<p>How can blockchain tech support simpler creation of agreements and resolving commercial disputes
<p>international trade depends on making contracts between different jurisdictions - GATT and WTO trade agreements have enabled this
<p>seamlessly executed smart contracts will disrupt not only contracts but interational law too
<p>the global economy is about $75T this year, growing at 3.1%
<p>Blockchain Macroeconomic potential is high - the WEF predicts 10% of global GDP on blockchain by 2025
<p>The WTO predicts a 15% tech trade boost by 2035 - 55% in China
<p>the biggest contribution to the financial crisis was lack of transparency of exposure of companies to each other - a blockchain approach could have made this more trasparent
<p>there are sovereign blockchain experiments going on in many countries, including multiple in Africa
<p>Blockchain is resisted by contract law compliance, trade protectionism, customs brokers, and big companies opaque supply chains
<p>manufacturing is a $12T global industry - it is growing in California again now
<p>Manufacturing supply chain problems include exclusive relationships, centralized asset control, and RoI models for CapEx that punish R&D
<p>supply chain with blockchain has decentralized protection of assets, and ledger of Things, enabling tracing of supply chains - this should replace cloud Enterprise Resource Management
<p>Deloitte 2017 said 58% of manufacturers were implementing Blockchain
<p>Our MFG token is meant to incentivize manufacturerers to be more responsive when quoting, and when redesigning 
<p>you ask them about blockchain and they understand blocks and chains; you ask about bitcoin and they say "isn't that a fraud?"

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.zyen.com'>Michael Mainelli</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'd like to talk about the economic impact of smart ledgers on world trade
<p>Z/Yen is the city of London's leading commercial think tank - where finance meets technology
<p>I've been putting computers into technology for 34 years so putting lipstick on the pig of a retail bank doesn't interest me
<p>i built my first distributed ledger back in 1995 - I found some as far back as the 1970s
<p>the block chain example of the distributed ledger is not  a particularly good one, so I want to define things more carefully
<p>mutual distributed ledger is a record of transactions shared in common and stored in multiple locations
<p>mutual means shared in common, owned by a community - the internet is owned by nobody it is mutual in that sense
<p>when people in business say that they haven't done mutual things before I point out email
<p>we do a lot of research to back up my prejudices - just brought out a report on the impact of quantum computing on mutual ledgers
<p>think very hard about the data you are writing out if you don't have a quantum resistant approach to it
<p>what we have here is just time stamping - you can put a token on it if you like
<p>it's a multiorganisational database with super audit trails, but it is a pretty crap database, so everyone using it will put a buffer database in front of it
<p>normally the central third party keeps the ledger - now we can reduce the switching costs of the central party
<p>smart ledgers: executable code is data too - executable code in a ledger is useful without tokens too
<p>metrognomo is our time stamping engine for the channle islands
<p>we do a lot of recording of clinical trials in a ledgers - 15m clinical assessments last year - a timestamping engine so that people don't cheat
<p>I'm really excited about areas like identity - identity, documentation and information exchange
<p>until last year I ran a commercial vessel - it involves a lot of moving of bits of paper, and it being questioned by people is what their job is
<p>if you need 40 pieces of paper to move a boat, and the number of times they get bounced back and forth ends up costing a lot
<p>then some banker comes in to show a distributed ledger to move money, and if it ever works, it goes up in price because of the transaction costs
<p>in Geneva I saw Ripple say that a team of 8 engineers had taken 8 weeks to move $8 for $3 - and a chap from VISA asked 'you do know that we do that millions of times a day for 3¢?'
<p>Anyone who says they they are giving you database write for $35 they are an idiot
<p>we did 25 billion transactions a day on our test rig - it could scale up to 1 trillion a day
<p>We have a report on the Economic impact of Smart Ledgers on World Trade coming out in April
<p>we're doing some work with the Singaporeans - we have about 500 companies on our exchange - they created an unowned ledger on our ChainZ software
<p>It's called fasttrack trade - it's like Alibaba but decentralised - on a smart ledger
<p>we have a distributed ledger of record at the bottom - you still need a database on top of it
<p>there are 3 mutual levels - at the base there is a mutual distributed ledger protocol; next level up is business process, and that simplifies transactions; above that identity, documentation and agreement reduces uncertainty
<p>we can see about a $25bn saving globally, but divided by the planet its not much, and compared to the cryptocurrency valuations, very low. I'll leave that with you.
<p>we also found that there could be maybe a million new jobs, spread across the planet. So I've been unable to find the mega blockchain revolution that people keep selling

<p>we focus on the creative industries and on manufacturing
<p>Think how disrupted the music industry has beeen of the past few years, and see how that might apply to other forms of industry
<p>we try and build spaces of collaboration for companies and startups to apply new technologies
<p>one example is that in the games industry you often get small groups collaborating on things, and then some of them take off - so we use the blockchain to attribute their contributions
<p>as part of the system we enabled dispute resolutions so when companies break up they can decide on distribution of the assets
