<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://jkphl.is'>Joschi Kuphal 吉</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>It's Demo time at Indiewebcamp Düsseldorf - live stream at <a class="auto-link" href="https://youtu.be/8SXNwRouvAE">https://youtu.be/8SXNwRouvAE</a> <iframe class="youtube-player auto-link figure" width="480" height="385" style="border:0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8SXNwRouvAE"></iframe> chat at <a class="auto-link" href="https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/today">https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/today</a>

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://aaronparecki.com/'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have album posts now on my own site like flickr, which will collect comments
<p>so each photo that is in an album has links to the rest of the album
<p>I started working on the tiled layout of photos for the album - on flickr every row is full width
<p>the secret is that the rows aren't all the same height, os they can make it fit that way
<p>people who build this kind of thing don't tend to make it work without javascript
<p>I'm not going to use flexbox for this - I'm working on laying it out in JS
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the flickr library was open sourced a month ago, and the inputs are all the aspect ratios of the images
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://adactio.com'>Jeremy Keith</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I didn't end up doing what I said I was going to do, but I started fixing plumbing and never stopped
<p>my webmention handling wasn't very good, as I built it on a 15 year old db table for comments
<p>so now I have a custom table that stores responses, likes and so on better
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a> posted a beer yesterday, which now is parsed correctly
<p>I've been using a  deprecated twitter call for posting  images - so I updated
<p>so the demo that didn't work yesterday now does - it POSSEs to twitter and flickr
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@vandrijevik'>Vladimir Andrijevikj</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I did some cleanup and added things to my travel plans to show events at the top
<p>and I made the stays an h-event not an h-card so it had duration too
<p>and I cleaned up the markup
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://adactio.com'>Jeremy Keith</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>It's OK to have more than one location for an event - that can be true [ie I'm not in Duusseldorf]
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://fmarx.com/'>Frederic Marx</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>my site <a class="auto-link" href="http://fmarx.com/">http://fmarx.com/</a> uses a static site generator, <a class="auto-link" href="http://metalsmith.io">metalsmith.io</a>
<p>medium has a feature where it works out what a link on a line at its own means
<p>for vimeo I don't want to put iframes in my markdown, so I expand links that are embedded
<p>if href== text content I can auto-add richer links
<p>and I have webmentions working too
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://emmahodge.org'>Emma Hodge</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I had 3 objectives today - organising homepage, layout and fonts, and photos
<p>I have new fonts and played around with layouts, and got photos upload working
<p>I downloaded the Mac github client and atom editor so that I have good tools for my site
<p>Andreas describes himself as a notorious team player and I endorse that description
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://matthiasott.com'>Matthias Ott</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I am now receiving webmention successfully at <a class="auto-link" href="https://matthiasott.com">https://matthiasott.com</a> 
<p>and I have likes and repost parsing working too

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://keithandrews.com'>Keith Andrews</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have an html slideshow linked from my talks using rSlidy

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://glennjones.net/'>Glenn Jones</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I had a look at an app called owntracks that runs in the background on the phone as web apps don't do that
<p>this app logs your location and send events when you arrive at a geofenced location
<p>it has a find your friends feature, which uses MQTT to send events that I can tap into
<p>it sends lat long and time out via json to a webhook post
<p>in future I want tot take it a bit further and do chrome notifications SO I can check in from those events
<p></blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bastianallgeier.com'>Bastian Allgeier</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'ma  fan of Airtable - a google spreadsheet alternative that gives an api for everything
<p>it has a lot of prebuilt column types and layouts that are useful
<p>now airtable is a hosted service, so I wanted a backend for myself
<p>i wanted to make it file based as that is easier to back up
<p>I define a schema but with column types that are good for online use 
<p>the posts end up in YAML files so they are easy to back up
