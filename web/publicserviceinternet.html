<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.thebillblog.com/'>Bill Thompson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm currently ensconced in BBC R&D - I used be head of the Archive Development partnership team - but what I want to do is use IP based servce to make society better, rather thna just making broadcasting better
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@solanasaurus'>Solana Larsen</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I was an editor with Global voices, changing the balance of power about who gets to make history.
<p>More recently I have been thinking about what went wrong with the internet, and worked with Mozilla on the Internet Health Report
<p>we want to help people navigate the minefields and find the places where the internet is still an opportunity - how the internet adapts to our choices and how we measure what is going wrong
<p>there are a lot of things going well wiht the interenet despite a lot fo us being down on it now <a class="auto-link" href="https://internethealthreport.org/">https://internethealthreport.org/</a>
<p>the mission of public service broadcast was never just to make TV programs, but to do more
<p>not just in the UK, but in Germany and Denmark, public broadcast is discouraged from doing anything on the internet as it is competition with commercial entities and this is stunting progress

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghan-m-8218b64/'>Meghan McDermott</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>What are the values that resonate for you?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Inform and educate matters
<p>broadcast started with great ideas and was about public service, but it has become about broadcasting
<p>Ultimately this is all about trust and how trusts transcends these forms
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@solanasaurus'>Solana Larsen</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Funding is key too - whose role is it to pay for these things? It is the consumer that pays for the internet- why isn't it free
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.pelicancrossing.net'>Wendy M. Grossman</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the internet started out as a cooperative where everyone paid for their piece of it 
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.thebillblog.com/'>Bill Thompson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the BBC was not created ot make radio and television programmes, but to deliver the goals of Educate, inform and entertain - radio and TV are no longere th ebst way to achieve these goals
<p>Is the BBc's understanding of an internet that serves the public good the same as everyone else's - it's not clear if our perspective will scale
<p>I was profoundly effected by Larry Lessig's book Code - that code is law, and we can change it. It's not the messiah, it's just a very naughty network
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghan-m-8218b64/'>Meghan McDermott</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>why is the conversation happening now, who is the we and who is the they?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@solanasaurus'>Solana Larsen</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm worried about the global dystopian surveillance society, and anyone who reads the newspaper can see this now - free speech, freedom of movement everything is at risk
<p>No-one says that "the medium is the message" any more, but it is still true we need to see
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I mostly work with US government funding in media access - we want to make it independent and viable
<p>this reminds me of the history of the london underground where each line was owned by a separate company, before we realised that public ownership made sense
<p>I'm from canada- the canadian govt made internet access a basic right, but it didn't change much?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.thebillblog.com/'>Bill Thompson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Access to what - today's interent si no always healthy
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>one is about equity - everyone having access, but also a commons, a collective good
<p>What internet are we talking about? facebook and surveillance, about access to IP routing ot about where computers are on borders
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.thebillblog.com/'>Bill Thompson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>All the way down the stack - I think we need to rewrite TCP/IP to build a stack with public service virtues
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@solanasaurus'>Solana Larsen</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>It's access, infrastructure, how it works - all the layers

</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.thebillblog.com/'>Bill Thompson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Trust and confidence - it would be significantly harder for anyone other than state actors to subvert what you are routing to
<p>the sorts of things that you end up building to make a public service internet can also enable surveillance
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.pelicancrossing.net'>Wendy M. Grossman</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>were you prorposing to blow up capitalism?

</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>freedom and security are 2 things we need - the more you protect free speech, the mroe you allow crime at speed - fraud at unprecedented scales
<p>when you are thinking about the kinds of things we want to protect - we may not like having 10 different apps to talk to people, but that canbe undermined by governments too
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghan-m-8218b64/'>Meghan McDermott</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>is it an either/or or a yes and? Who should be at the table - how do we not use language to mean different things?

<p>you . don't want to pitch this as an alternative to, but a choice - you can choose the existing chaos
<p>build something that can grow through use ratehr than be imposed
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.pelicancrossing.net'>Wendy M.

</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='q'>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>borders and boundaries matter too - does the BBC see it ending within its own border? Does the World Service matter too?
<p>sometimes public services have competing interests - do I take a bit of Deutsche Welle, RTA and BBC is it just about the country
