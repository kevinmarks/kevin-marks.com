<p>VCs would rather see you die than hit a double or triple when they need a home run 
<p>We should promote flow over growth - look at velocity of money rather then growth. Bring back dividends
<p>How about banks encouraging businesses to crowd fund as well as giving loans to create a local stake
<p>Uber has drivers doing R&D for a robot car company that will destroy their jobs - what if they had ownership too?
<p>SV stock options are weird instruments that only pay out on a unicorn event that pays the VCs more

<p>when we started we wanted to build a factory in detroit that would employ 100 people and make watches 
<p>I left Fossil after working there 26 years, and I liked the idea of mechanical watches built in Detroit
<p>we ended up creating between 350 and 375 in Detroit and ~200 elsewhere
<p>we were originally going to make watches for other companies, but we ordered parts for 2500 watches to try out
<p>and put them out for $500 and they sold out straight away
<p>Our second category was bicycles - we met Richard Schwinn who made a hundred bikes a year, and ordered 1000
<p>Once the demand for watches showed up, we opened stores and sold the watches and bikes and looked for other things
<p>We wanted to make notebooks that people would love, that smelled like your first grade textbooks
<p>we're trying to grow small batch runs that will create jobs in America that grow employment
<p>We found that the small batch price came in at $7 for american manufacture, when we were expecting $12
<p>This isn't a Made In America play, this is a job creation vehicle - people want to know what companies stand for

<p>I said we'd like to get the President to give one of our watches to the president of Switzerland…
<p>We made a presidential watch, and we got Krystal to present it to him. 
<p>Now Krystal started out cleaning floors in our factory, then learned to make watches and now manages 14 people
<p>We were buying our straps in from Florida, but we ended up building our own strap factory to fulfil our own demand
<p>now they're making small leather goods and bags as well - because we invested in the training to create the jobs

<p>These folks are great at providing a service - it mostly goes very well
<p>it starts with us mining the web and brings back a machine score - if you have no info we run additional checks
<p>our biggest categories are local movers, entertainers these roll up to Home Improvement or Event Services
<p>int he US customers spend $700B on local services - and most of it doesn't happen online yet
<p>Google and Amazon have pitches here - if they're not competing with you then the market isn't big enough

<p>I spent a week in Washington talking to lawmakers about augmented reality and overlaying things on the world
<p>trying to avoid laws being too reactive to this kind of thing
<p>we turn the entire world into a virtual gameboard - you go out there with your phone to find the pokemon monsters
<p>the goal was to get people out of the house and to explore their cities more
<p>I grew up in a small town of 1000 people in West Texas - it was a boring place to grow up
<p>there's a lot to be said for boredom - if your kids are bored they will make things up
<p>a teacher gave us old issues of National Geographic and the photos and maps sparked my imaginations
<p>I grew up coding games, and met people from SGI - they built flight simulations 
<p>the inspiration of Keyhole was to bring these rich maps from industry to everybody

<p>we started out with the satellite imagery and naively put geopolitical boundaries on top of it
<p>and it turns out many governments care a lot about where you draw the boundaries - it carries a lot of power
<p>with Niantic we wondered if adding things to the virtual world could influence the real world

<p>so as you walk around it would show you a card about the places or read it into your earpiece
<p>
<p>as it turns out Field Trip was a kinda nerdy concept - a PBS view of the world
<p>when we added these places to an interactive game it took off - first Ingress and then pokemon go

<p>what we're talking about is the future of city as community, where we know the people there 
<p>Cities were designed for a different use - in the future they will look more like villages
<p>instead fo the mass chains you will have more and more local businesses
<p>because the small businesses will have reputations so you don't need the brands uniformity

<p>every single city said 'we understand you did that, but we're different'
<p>many cites have their own registration systems that they want you to plug into
<p>I hoped we would be able to bring them together better, but there are a lot of systems
<p>every city has something different - SF wants us to only use home people live in, Tokyo wants commercial ones
<p>before you regulate something you should understand it and try to use it
<p>we have relationships with a lot of cites - when we have an open discussion and it works out well

<p>LA is a good example - we have created lots of possibilities where people can stay outside the hotel district
<p>The average middle class family has not grown income in years; airBnB can contribute to helping this
<p>in 2012 people wanted to offer their homes for free for Hurricane Sandy - we built a disaster response tool
<p>and there's a system to remit help for the disasters via FEMA 
<p>many of our partnerships with cities start with disaster relief
<p>when people look at AirBnB they see a bunch of spaces - the heart is the people, not their spaces
<p>I don't think technology needs to leave people behind, it an make cities better in future
<p>Infrastructure is needed, but remapping cites to make them more like villages can recreate opportunity

<p>AI can listen to everyone at once - it can scale up what the government can take in
<p>listening is magic - allowing people to know that policy will pay attention to what you say is transforming
<p>for example: how should the governmnet regulate UberX
<p>there is a 'what do you think' box, then there are questions created by others
<p>200 comments from 6000 people is nto good for humans but machine learning can make sense of it
<p>so we can visualise opinion groups, and how they move about on different questions
<p>but we can also find consensus between the different subgroups, which is normally hard to find
<p>We need to have a platform to allow the entire society to engage in rational discussion - Minister Jaclyn Tsai
<p>this led to vTaiwan - a place to create binding policy on Taiwan
<p>direct democracy is something that we can build online  - Corbyn's #DigitalDemocracy is based on this too 
<p>sending signals on complex issues in a binary presidential vote is not helping. We need to disagregate
