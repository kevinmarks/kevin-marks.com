<p>welcome to the indiewebcamp summit - this is our website <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/">http://indiewebcamp.com/</a>
<p>you may notice that we have a new logo <a class="auto-link" href="http://svgur.com/s/5F">http://svgur.com/s/5F</a> - <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/veganstraightedge">@veganstraightedge</a> redesigned <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/crystalbeasley">@crystalbeasley</a>'s original
<p>we started out with "Show don't tell" "scratch your own itch" and "self-dogfooding"
<p>the real point is that it's your site, you are in control and you can do what you want with it
<p>all of this starts with one goal: self-empowerment. As we achieve different levels of that we can spread empowerment
<p>we ecnourage everyone to share what they have built whether on our wiki or a open source code on github or wherever
<p>we have a set of open formats which we have incubated and dogfooded ourselves, and then take them to standards bodies
<p>one of these is Webmention, which is now a w3c Candidate Recommendation <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/</a> well done <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a>
<p>webmention is out looking for implementations, and you can test yours at webmention.rocks
<p>another spec, Micropub for posting to your site is a w3C Editors draft <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/</a>
<p>another great indieweb tool is <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> which will connect your site to the social silos so non-indie people can see
<p>this is a photo I posted last week of homebrew website club <a class="auto-link" href="http://tantek.com/2016/154/t1/homebrew-website-club-mozilla-sf">http://tantek.com/2016/154/t1/homebrew-website-club-mozilla-sf</a> with people tags on
<p>with <a class="auto-link" href="http://Brid.gy">Brid.gy</a> my photo was copied to flickr <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/27387113266/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/27387113266/</a> and facebook <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/10102317495976283">https://www.facebook.com/10102317495976283</a>
<p>and the facebook one had the person tags come through intact thanks to bridgy remapping them
<p>we have over 1000 users on the wiki and there are tens of 1000s of indieweb sites that are actively deploying building blocks
<p>many of those users are on <a class="auto-link" href="http://withknown.com">withknown.com</a> - so we have grown by 10x each year the number of indieweb sites
<p>we're probably at defcon3 for a large wbmention spam attack, so implementing <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/Vouch">http://indiewebcamp.com/Vouch</a> would be good
<p>here's a video of indieweb passing the SWAT0 test last year: <a class="auto-link" href="https://aaronparecki.com/notes/2015/07/14/1/swat0">https://aaronparecki.com/notes/2015/07/14/1/swat0</a>
<p>the key thing this weekend is make something, anything for your own site, however small
<p>and talk to people and see how you can collaborate - code, design, copywriting - work together
<p>don't let the pursuit of perfection stop you making progress. get something working, show it, iterate

<p>the idea here is to make owning my own social content seamless, so I don't have to think about it
<p>I have to think about it when I'm writing <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a>, but if you install code you shouldn't have to
<p>now we shouldn't need to check each others' websites all the time to see if they have posted, but Kyle has an answer

<p>You can subscribe to indieweb sites that use microfromats for markup, or sites that use older feeds in Atom and RSS

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>part of using the indieweb seamlessly is being able to post from anywhere so I'm posting from my phone

<p>once it is posted it can be seen anywhere from mobile or desktop browser
<p>one of the things I want to do is video, though doing that with a web browser is hard.
<p>because I have an iphone I can't let you record audio from a web browser, but working on making that better

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://aaronparecki.com/'>Aaron Parecki</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I want to show you more about how my reply worked. I don't have a posting ui on my website
<p>I use woodwind.xyz, but mainly use <a class="auto-link" href="http://quill.p3k.io">quill.p3k.io</a> which is a micropub client I wrote I log in with indieauth
<p>That worked almost too well  - I was already logged in so it just worked. let me log out and show the process
<p>so when I am asked to login I get an indieauth prompt asking for posting permissions via micropub
<p>q: if you have static files built from a static site generator, can you still use micropub?
<p>yes you can because people have built tools that let you post to git from micropub

<p>I've built a lot of go libraries - the go webmention library includes this command line tool
