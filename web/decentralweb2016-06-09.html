<h2>Indieweb - Ryan Barrett</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we of the indieweb are really excited to be here with you tackling these big exciting problems
<p>we have been taking a smaller scale approach reusing existing technology
<p>we thought what is the smallest, most mature technology we can reuse - we started with the domain
<p>if you own your own domain you are in control of your presence on the web
<p>we looked at social networks and there is a lot you can do there - such as events
<p>so how do we do this on our sites? I post an event on my site and see who comes
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/kevinmarks">@kevinmarks</a> sees this event and posts it on his own website - <a class="auto-link" href="http://known.kevinmarks.com">known.kevinmarks.com</a>
<p>his RSVP is marked up with microformats showing that it is an RSVP that says yes
<p>To tell my site about this it he uses webmention - source is his RSVP target is my event
<p>my site can read his microformats and show this as an RSVP acceptance
<p>this is just one example of a ton of functionality we have with some very small protocols
<p>~100M sites already have microformats - your site may already be party indieweb
<p>join us at <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com">indiewebcamp.com</a>
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'>Q:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>are microformats something you guys invented, why did you choose html rather than json?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Microformats were created by people involved wiht indiewebcamp like <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/t">@t</a>
<p>we chose HTML because it is already there - there is lots of existing sites to wrok with
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'>Q:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>can you explain the connection between indieweb and w3c SocailWG?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we have brought many of the indieweb building blocks to socialwg and webmention and micropub are on standards track
<p>my slides are at <a class="auto-link" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rQB6ZG-4saj0-BqQYxtPAebSzLWpNGcHAGTEnDtKQP8/">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rQB6ZG-4saj0-BqQYxtPAebSzLWpNGcHAGTEnDtKQP8/</a>

<h2>Dan Gillmor and Richard Stallman</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://dangillmor.com/'>Dan Gillmor</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm dazzled by what I see here, and by the people here who see what is going on
<p>I'm not a technologist, I'm a writer and a teacher and we need to explain this better to the wider public
<p>it's about more than a decentralized web, but about control too - net neutrality may be a short term victory
<p>and we are always under surveillance by governments and companies
<p>some journalists have ties to the centralization community - Comcast owns NBC for example
<p>we need to tell journalists how they can use free software - we need to make it more convenient for them
<p>finally we need to tell better stories. People react more to stories than to facts.
<p>we have heard a lot about the Facebook revolutions, but not about FB ToS kicking activists off
<p>please send me email to dan@gillmor.com wiht your ideas to help
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://stallman.org'>Richard Stallman</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>there is massive surveillance that threatens democracy itself 
<p>when you're working on distributed systems, try to solve the problems of freedom too
<p>making an internet that respects our freedoms requires thinking about policies as well as code
<p>if you care about free software go to <a class="auto-link" href="http://gnu.org/help">gnu.org/help</a> and see how you can help
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'>Q:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>every time you say distributed systems you weaken the decentralization movement
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://stallman.org'>Richard Stallman</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I was meaning distributed amongst the users, but I take your point

<h2>Rebooting the Web of Trust - Christopher Allen</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.LifeWithAlacrity.com'>Christopher Allen</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Monday was the 25th anniversary of PGP. Nobody celebrated this on twitterdom
<p>PGP didn't succeed. It is barely used except for code signing.
<p>I started #RebootingTheWebOfTrust to change this - it's like a hackathon for white papers
<p>to join  #RebootingTheWebOfTrust the entry fee is posting a reading list
<p>we wrote white papers on "what is the web of trust", "use cases", "crteating a distributed registry"
<p>this led to Self-Sovereign Identity - you are the source of your own identity
<p>identity is not an administrative mechanism for others to control
<p>this inspired a UN identity conference #ID2020
<p>we have a lot of white papers in progress, and a 3rd conference in Sept 2016  go to <a class="auto-link" href="http://weboftrust.info">weboftrust.info</a>
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'>Q:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>why do you think PGP failed?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.LifeWithAlacrity.com'>Christopher Allen</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>a lot of factors; centralised control has a lot of advantages; competition with S/MIME
<p>also PGP did not allow you to check keys by attestation
</blockquote></div>
<h2>Namecoin - Jeremy Rand</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@biolizard89'>Jeremy Rand</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Namecoin is the first global, human-readable and decentralized naming system [he completed zooko's triangle]
<p>namecoin is a fork of bitcoin that represents name -> value pairs as special coins
<p>I have namecoin verified HTTPS working but only in Chrome for Windows at the moment
<p>normally looking up data in bitcoin or namecoin requires downloading the whole chain ~3GB, now SVP enables less

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/'>Greg Lindahl</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Dogfood your system -if it isn't useful to you what makes you think it will be useful to anyone else?

<h2>Open Annotation - Dan Whaley</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://hypothes.is'>Dan Whaley</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Problem: right now you can only have conversations on very small parts of the web
<p>or you can have conversations, but only in silos like twitter and reddit
<p><a class="auto-link" href="http://hypothes.is">http://hypothes.is</a> wants to make an open conversation across the web
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/pmarca">@pmarca</a> announced an open annotation system in Mosaic in 1993, but turned it off after a few months
<p>in december we announced a coalition fo 70 academic publishers to begin implementing open annotation on their content
<p>we runa  service that launched in early 2015 25k registered users; on target for 1m annotation by the end of the year
<p>there's a browser extension and a proxy that you can use
<p>right now it is centralized, on our servers we want to conenct the client ot anny annotation server
<p>lets say we find As We May Think from 1945 <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/</a>
<p>and you can see the annotations at the proxy at <a class="auto-link" href="https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/</a>
<p>here's my annotation: <a class="auto-link" href="https://hypothes.is/a/MSrpWC6XEeaxkqPid_QoMA">https://hypothes.is/a/MSrpWC6XEeaxkqPid_QoMA</a> on the <a class="auto-link" href="http://hypothes.is">hypothes.is</a> site
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>have you looked at using webmention to tell sites that they have been annotated?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://hypothes.is'>Dan Whaley</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we have and we're very excited by webmention - we'd love to get more done with it

<h2>BigchainDB - Alberto Granzotto</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.bigchaindb.com/'>Alberto Granzotto</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>IPDB is Interplanetary Database - you can create assets, trasnfer assets and query
<p>you use our driver with a keypair stored in your client 
<p>we have a foundation of caretakers we want >50% nonprofir and <50% in the same geography
<p>IPDB is powered by BigchainDB an AGPL-3 licenced blockahin database
<p>we currently have 15 caretakers decide who is in and out, we want this fully decentralized in future

<h2>Content Addressing - Ben Trask</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://hash-archive.org/'>Ben Trask</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I am sure you'er all sick of content addressing by now, so I'll keep it short
<p>the thing about content addressing is that it is only one thing - a form of eventual consistency
<p>it can't give you real ordering - you can't know which of 2 things that happened first
<p>one thing about content addresses is that they are strictly superior to UUIDs - like RSS
<p>some people like UUIDs in their databases as primary keys
<p>the good thing about content hashes as primary IDs is that they give good collisions - actual duplicates
<p>strong consistency is really cool - they only technology out there now is the blockchain.
<p>you can use the blockchain to decide who gets to vote in a different consistency algorithm, eg use Paxos
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href=''>q</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>your suggestion for the bigchaindb architecture - that is how it works
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://hash-archive.org/'>Ben Trask</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>you could elect the caretakers using a blockchain
<p>I only know of 3 consensus models - Raft and Paxos are distributed but not decentralized, but Blockchain is
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'>Q:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>what is stronglink?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://hash-archive.org/'>Ben Trask</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Stronglink is a content addressing system similar to ipfs, webtorrent dat and all the others
<p>the unique thing about stronglink is thar it can do full queries and full syncing
<p><a class="auto-link" href="https://hash-archive.org/">https://hash-archive.org/</a> is a database of mapping between hashes of other things, primarily URLs
<p>so it adds a bit of security to insecure downlaods
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://archive.org'>Brewster Kahle</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>DHT as embodied in bittorrent always seems to be slow. Are we doomed?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://hash-archive.org/'>Ben Trask</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>content addressing doesn't require consistency so it can be fast, so you can just do it
<p>things only get slow when you need to traverse the network and talk to other people
</blockquote></div>
<h2>Nodesphere - Harlan T Wood</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.harlantwood.net/'>Harlan T Wood</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Core Network is a distributed social network that is visualisation first
<p>you're looking at a direct visualisation of the network which you can manipulate or view differently
<p>or a visualisation could look like a social network wall
<p>friends of mine kept developing new graph viz networks so we defined nodesphere
<p>in VR will we have little windows in front of ours, or will we build our own cathedrals at large scale
</blockquote></div>
<h2>Platform Cooperatives - Maira Sutton</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.shareable.net/'>Maira Sutton</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I was at EFF fighting international treaties that had IP policy in them, like TPP
<p>the big problem was that these were secret, and they only cared about what big companies said
<p>I shifted to <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.shareable.net/">http://www.shareable.net/</a> which is a magazine that writes about libraries, platform co-operatives and more
<p>the idea of a platform cooperative is that the site is owned not just by the developers but the owners too
<p>I want to see a decentralized web that is democratic, transparent and co-operative
<p>mass surveillance by states, censorship by copyright and siloization are all people problems
<p>there are concentrations of politicsl and economic power that lead to these problems
<p>we need to open up the process of bringing diversity to this movement - 
<p>we won't be able to assess the values of this movement without bring more people into this who aren't in this room
<p>as <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/doctorow">@doctorow</a> said, we need to create a Ulysses pact so we can't trade away the values that we hold
<p>please try to do more outreach, so if you run future conferences more people can find out and attend
</blockquote></div>
<h2>Zcash - Zooko Willcox</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://z.cash/team.html'>zooko</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Zcash is a distributed financial system like blockchain, but it has a layer of encryption on top
<p>people know that bitcoin is all transparent all of the time - everything is all transparent all of the time
<p>zcash has selective transparency - you can build transparency on top of privacy, but not the other way round
<p>you can reveal a transaction to someone else that is in the blockchain - 
<p>privacy and selective transparency combined with canonical knowledge that is available
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://snarfed.org/'>Ryan Barrett</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>you're both really idealistic and really pragmatic - i like that
<p>how do you get the traditional financial system involved so they don't fight you?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://z.cash/team.html'>zooko</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>when I talk to banks they are dismissive of the open permissionless thing, but are used to bitcoin and ethereum
<p>it's not just fro money you can also have rules that are encoded into blockchains
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.harlantwood.net/'>Harlan T Wood</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>could zcash be the primary currency of the planet?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://z.cash/team.html'>zooko</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>not yet; it still has similar rate issues to bitcoin but we expect to improve that 
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://archive.org'>Wendy Hanamura</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we heard from the OGs and the New Guys - you'r an MG, in the middle generation. What's the perspective
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://z.cash/team.html'>zooko</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>in computer science we are privileged to rub elbows with the giants on whose shoulders we stand
<p>I've been impressed here with how far along a lot of these projects are
<p>in the near future you'll be abel to do smart contracts on ethereum, then transfer the results into zcash
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'>Q:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>if we're hiding contracts, how do we solve investigating things like subprime loans?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://z.cash/team.html'>zooko</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>for the forseeable future, giant rich corrupt organizations are going to use the current banking system
<p>in the long run there are combinations of transparency and privacy that will evolve that are good for scoiety

<h2>Archive Labs - Mek Karpeles</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://michaelkarpeles.com/'>Mek Karpeles</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I partied last night too by making slides - they're up at archive labs
<p>my name is Mek and I fight for the users - in this case the archive labs fellows
<p>Archive labs incubates open and community initiatives
<p>IPFS hosting one of our internet archive books - our boo reader in IPFS - <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/davidar">@davidar</a> did this
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/wumpus">@wumpus</a> said it's OK to hack things together if you make ti up in volume
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aeschylus">@aeschylus</a> helped me combine a book from fragments at  multiple institutions using iiif 
<p>we had a volunteer <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/jessew">@jessew</a> notice that we have had torrents at the archive so <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/feross">@feross</a> helped us integrate webtorrents
<p>webtorrents is now available for 10M plus files
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/btrask">@btrask</a> the <a class="auto-link" href="https://hash-archive.org/">https://hash-archive.org/</a> allows us to verify the integrity of software that may not still be available
<p>and <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/btrask">@btrask</a> built his own little paper hub at stronglink
<p>Calls to action: apply for a fellowship and join our archivelab slack
<p>Lets write a document for the DW3C - create a repository to work on a document  together
