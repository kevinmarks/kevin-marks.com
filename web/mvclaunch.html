<p><a class='h-card' href='http://katelosse.tv'>kate losse</a>:  <blockquote><p>surveillance technologies have become palpable—white men have become the watched, when they were the watchers
<p>true transparency in the tech industry would be about power across the board - who has it, who uses it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>@shanley and I are cofounders of Model View Culture
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>I've been in the tech community for the last 5 years, but never again. I'm excited to be in tech media
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>Last year Bustle launched a media site for women with $6.5M. @shanley and I were furious
<p>When women can't get money form VC, why can men get $6,5M to write about women
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>Mainstream technology is funded by VC, and it is toxic. They cover women as special interest and linkbait
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>Confeerneces are adopting codes of conduct @transhack @blackgirlscode and more are building community
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>we see a massive need and a massive market for a new kind of tech media for diversity in tech
<p>if you look at one of these communities it looks pretty small, but when you add them up it is huge
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>56% of women leave the tech industry within 10 years, and we were reaching that point
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>a picture of the 300 pages of paperwork we did to get incorporated - being a startup isn't as glamourous
<p>we had to make sure we couldn't have our home addresses looked up in the state registries
<p>we had to make sure we couldn't be DoS'd by the hate groups
<p>we paid our Authors a week late as our Bank spelled Femenist
<p>We tried to do interviews with mainstream media, and they wanted to know what our site did for white men
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>despite it all, 2 weeks ago we launched our first issue, and it went really well
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>we spend a lot of time working with writers. We have mobile offices 
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>what I like about DIY is that we get to cook lunch - we spend our money on authors
<p>we don't have fancier equipment than out laptops and we take public transportation
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>we don't think we can maintain our editorial independence if we take VC or mainstream ads
<p>Another thing that is really important is that we pay our writers
<p>if you're marginalised, people try to get you to write for exposure. We need more than that, bro.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're excited and dedicated to producing lots of print media - that you can leave on the table at work
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>We pay writers. Send us your ideas - we will have themed issues, but send us contributions
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>If you have imposter syndrome, please contribute anyway
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>we will walk you through imposter syndrome, it's a speciality of ours
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>our next issue is exploring all the making happening outside the tech world
<p>we have a microphone now, so Model View Cast is coming
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>we'd love to do an art exhibition of 'shit men say to me on the internet'
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are unconfirmed reports that we are putting together a conference later this year
<p>our first print edition is going to layout tomorrow -15.000 words of not before published writing
<p>we're getting it printed at 1984 media in Oakland which is a woman-run printers
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>Buy it Buy it Buy it - modelviewculture.com/subscribe
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>thank you all for coming out
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>and thank you to all our writers
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flavors.me/drkrz'>Dr. Kortney Ziegler</a>:  <blockquote><p>I wrote the article on Mark Zuckerberg in MVC, and I work on TransHack
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://mattiebrice.com/'>Mattie Brice</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm at mattiebrice.com and write on games and inclusion
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ashedryden.com'>space feminist</a>:  <blockquote><p>A lot of the ideas of my writing is based on the DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself
<p>a lot of my writing comes form things that happen that I don't want to happen over and over again
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flavors.me/drkrz'>Dr. Kortney Ziegler</a>:  <blockquote><p>I work in music, video and write form my lived experience in tech or queerness -it's about me
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://mattiebrice.com/'>Mattie Brice</a>:  <blockquote><p>I do a lot of creative, fiction writing - being on twitter is the easiest idea fount ever
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>critique and cultural criticism can be emotionally charged - can you talk about the responses you get?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://mattiebrice.com/'>Mattie Brice</a>:  <blockquote><p>you have a blur between activists and those writing their lived experiences, and majority culture reacts
<p>it's hard to get it write - when you do it goes viral, when you don't it goes viral against you
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flavors.me/drkrz'>Dr. Kortney Ziegler</a>:  <blockquote><p>most of my writing has gone viral when I'm being oppressed; when I'm positive it's less well received
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ashedryden.com'>space feminist</a>:  <blockquote><p>I've had so many people come to me at conferences that invest trust in me as someone who will listen
<p>by being mad about things on the internet, people trust me. Which is not to say that you shouldn't
<p>on the other side I've had rape threats, death threats, been denied jobs, hand my friends attacked 
<p>it's so difficult because so many people wnt to be better, but are invested in not having to change
<p>there is a very vocal minority of people who are scary. I'm actually shaking now remembering it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>so many of may friends are being affected by internet threats every day
<p>one fo the biggest problems we face is financial stability
<p>gittip and patreon really inspired me - how do you fund your work?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flavors.me/drkrz'>Dr. Kortney Ziegler</a>:  <blockquote><p>when I founded transhack I did a crowdfunding campaign, but I wasn't know as legit in tech
<p>it took months to raise $6000, and taught me a lot about who gets funded
<p>people who look a certain way are supported, and it's not me
<p>I also invest my own money into projects - thats a way to be a leader
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://mattiebrice.com/'>Mattie Brice</a>:  <blockquote><p>I very recntly started to community funding as a writer
<p>online writing is very hard to get a livable wage
<p>to pay my rent I would need to write 30-40 1000 word articles a month - and that doesn't cover food
<p>video games publishing is even worse- game journalism is shrinkning
<p>I turned to crowdfunding - I use Patreon. It allows people who do have a following to make money by writing
<p>you can't just go on there and get money, you have to already have a following
<p>how do we have a collective of writers, when we are seen as lone wolves
<p>we need a new way of collective funding
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ashedryden.com'>space feminist</a>:  <blockquote><p>I make money two ways - a lot of people give me money on gittip, which gives money weekly
<p>I'm the top earner on gittip at the moment - it pays for catfood and trips - travel expenses
<p>I did an indiegogo to fund some other conference travel and got over $6000 from that
<p>I am probably the most privileged here
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>I'm interested in gittip and other funding models like this - we can take gittip money for MVC
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://mattiebrice.com/'>Mattie Brice</a>:  <blockquote><p>In games journalism there are 5 or 6 main publications; I've been told my writing is too feminist, risky
<p>it's hard to exist in a system that sees you as risky and weird. Games magazines are funded by men
<p>I've had publications like The Guardian that did not cite me reliably for my writing
<p>games journalism is already an iche; adding social justice makes it a nice of a niche
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ashedryden.com'>space feminist</a>:  <blockquote><p>I haven't done any writing for mainstream things, but a lot of journalists follow me and take our ideas
<p>this validates our ideas, but it doesn't give you control of your ideas
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>the day we launched every editor of a mainstream outlet followed us but only 1 wrote about us. Damn you.
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flavors.me/drkrz'>Dr. Kortney Ziegler</a>:  <blockquote><p>to have our own platforms we need to be funded by the community -it doesn't work in tech
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://mattiebrice.com/'>Mattie Brice</a>:  <blockquote><p>write now in Games Social Justice, dealing with anger is a big problem - people burn out
<p>when you are asked over and over again by ignirant people about rape culture, you do burn out
<p>people only want to talk to us when we eviscerate someone online - it becomes a blood sport
<p>I could really use people who want to talk more about healing
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ashedryden.com'>space feminist</a>:  <blockquote><p>a lot of people ask me about self care, but I'm really terrible at it. I have cats, they help
<p>pulling yourself out of the situation is hard
<p>the hardest thing is when I am upset about something, and no-one else is upset about it too
<p>having other people who understand about why I am angry, without having to tell them
<p>I get a lot of people who dm me on twitter saaing "I can't talk about this but someone has to"
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flavors.me/drkrz'>Dr. Kortney Ziegler</a>:  <blockquote><p>As I get older, I am finally starting to figure out that I need people in my life who hold me up
<p>My form of self care is growing my community of friends and people who love me
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.modelviewculture.com'>Shanley</a>:  <blockquote><p>how can people support you?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://flavors.me/drkrz'>Dr. Kortney Ziegler</a>:  <blockquote><p>transhack.org needs funding and support, and funding. help us
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://mattiebrice.com/'>Mattie Brice</a>:  <blockquote><p>there is a thing called 'support games criticism' - find them and help support us and promote us
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ashedryden.com'>space feminist</a>:  <blockquote><p>my website is ashedryden.com The best thing is having conversations you don't have to have and gittip
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.linguabee.com'>Linguabee</a>:  <blockquote><p>we're sponsoring sign language interpretation tonight
<p>I remember being interviewed with an interpreter who couldn't understand me, and had to use body language
<p>that experience taught me a lot. Many deaf people go through this very single day
<p>I'm sure you've heard about the Mandela fake deaf interpreter
<p>would it make sense that your communication needs would be brought by someone you don't know
<p>a lot of interpretation agencies are run by hearing people, not by deaf people
<p>with Linguabee we have an agency where the deaf people have access to all the information on the platform
<p>diversity is first and foremost, and people who have the same experience can link up to help
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://bookmaniac.org'>Liz Henry</a>:  <blockquote><p>I work now for Mozilla as a dev person, and I founded DoubleUnion, a feminist hacker/maker space
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.lpfi.org'>Jarvis Sulcer</a>:  <blockquote><p>I founded the level playing field institute that works to bring students of color into STEM
<p>we have a bridge between students aspirations and college - they don't have access to AP classes so we bridge
<p>we also run innovative computer science programs and hackathons
<p>think of a student in East Oakland who built an app to help them walk home from school safely
<p>I was an engineer for Hp and Agilent, now I run a non-profit in Oakland
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ingridavendano.com'>Ingrid Avendaño</a>:  <blockquote><p>I worked with @hackbright to be part of tech companies and hackathons
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>what are the big successes we're having in social justice?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ingridavendano.com'>Ingrid Avendaño</a>:  <blockquote><p>getting women and minorities into tech is hard-  I recently dropped out of school 
<p>I didn't even realise that I didn't have connections - there was such a barrier
<p>now there are so many oppportunities for companies to partner with these institutions
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.lpfi.org'>Jarvis Sulcer</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are a lot of STEM focused programs - we want students to use tech to solve problem in their community
<p>for example, to get students thinking about diet and food in their own community and what is available
<p>rather than just being consumers of technology, but creating tech too
<p>we have 56% of our students getting into college, compared to 23% overall
<p>don't just think about the big tech companies, but think how you can influence your local community with tech
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://bookmaniac.org'>Liz Henry</a>:  <blockquote><p>there are a lot of different pathways people can take, and I want people to start new projects
<p>people have to be inspired to connect with something for them and their community
<p>whatever you start, people will want to use it for something else - to recruit or steer you
<p>with DoubleUnion we wanted to serve the community of adult women who are inventors and makers
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>what surprised you most about your organisation growing?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.lpfi.org'>Jarvis Sulcer</a>:  <blockquote><p>one thing to think about when you start a new company is how you think about sustainability form the beginning
<p>the non-profit sector is about relationships in a mutually beneficial way
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://bookmaniac.org'>Liz Henry</a>:  <blockquote><p>the speed that we grew surprised me, and the amount of community support that meant we had hit a nerve
<p>
<p>use the strengths you have to help things happen
<p>information infrastructure matters - we learnt from open source communities about how that works
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ingridavendano.com'>Ingrid Avendaño</a>:  <blockquote><p> I joined code2040 I had a great internship, but I couldn't go back to school as I lost my scholarship
<p>i earned too much money on my internship and lost the $16000 I had to support my education
<p>hackbright became an opportunity that opened up for me to get a job out here
<p>I never thought I'd have the opportunities I have today - 
<p>mentors that believed I could hold a job out here made all the difference
<p>a lot of my peers had parents who were ngineers who taught them what to expect. I didn't have that
<p>I had no idea what I was getting myself into - that there were no women in tech
<p>my first computer science class was really miserable, but I built something at the end of it
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.lpfi.org'>Jarvis Sulcer</a>:  <blockquote><p>we have teenagers who are away from home on campuses in a dorm for 5 weeks together
<p>safety is number 1 for them to learn and fail comfortably
<p>they're used to getting the answers at the back of the book -it's OK if you find another way
<p>students come with different beliefs and values- they learn not to ridicule each other
<p>the stickiness of the program is the community these young people build
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://bookmaniac.org'>Liz Henry</a>:  <blockquote><p>it is really important in starting an organisation that you communicate expectations
<p>and once you have established the values you have to keep to them, and kick people out to enforce
<p>having a safe space for women shouldn't be revolutionary, but it is
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ingridavendano.com'>Ingrid Avendaño</a>:  <blockquote><p>lots of women and minorities get shorted when negotiating salaries you need peers to talk to
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>how can people support you?
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.lpfi.org'>Jarvis Sulcer</a>:  <blockquote><p>in kind tech services help a lot- build a website, volunteers and speakers, tours of companies
<p>there are students who live in Oakland who have never been to Berkeley, or East Palo Alto and Stanford
<p>and funding is also something we can use
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ingridavendano.com'>Ingrid Avendaño</a>:  <blockquote><p>for both the programs that I went through, we need mentors who can translate students interests
<p>both hackbright and code2040 partener with companies - get involved with them
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://bookmaniac.org'>Liz Henry</a>:  <blockquote><p>any kind of funding is great, but look for organisations doing work you respect and support them
<p>don't got in and tell organisations how you want them to fix the world
<p>asking and listening is good, don't tell them how to work
<p></blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://ameliagreenhall.com'>Amelia Greenhall</a>:  <blockquote><p>Chris Dancy has a piece published in the next quarterly
</blockquote>
<a class='h-card' href='http://www.chrisdancy.com'>Chris Dancy</a>:  <blockquote><p>the tech community of Sf today was built on the rainbow blood of the gay community that died in the 90s
<p>in the 2000s we had a new closet on social networks like facebook - we had to come out again
<p>most 20-30 year olds have never met anyone who has died from HIV</div>
