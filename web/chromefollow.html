<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@shekharsharad'>Shekhar Sharad</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>when we talked to people, they cared about a lot of different publishers on the web and wanted ot be updated about all the content from them
<p>from the publishers they want to build an audience and keep in touch with them.
<p>we want to bring the follow functionality to the open web using standards in chrome 
<p>we want this on open standards such as rss, and make the least amount of work for web publishers, and other readers can take advantage of
<p>we want this to be predictable via rss for which content to include, make follow/unfollow easy and opt out

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/janice-wong-b612496/'>Janice Wong</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>as I follow a site the content will appear in a new follow section on the new tab page
<p>there is a cog button to manage your follows and unfollow them
<p>looks at blog <a class="auto-link" href="http://whatsericplaying.com">whatsericplaying.com</a> and clicks on follow, which redirects to the following tab (shows posts chrononologically)
<p>[what's show are preview pages]
<p>this will appear on Chrome android in USA in the next few weeks, then other countreis later

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://ni.chol.as'>Nick Krasney</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>what exactly is RSS? it's been around since 1990s and widely used. webmasters can publish RSS or Atom google will poll feeds for this
<p>No RSS? No problem - we can build a feed from your content too, but it may be slower. Google will poll RSS often
<p>use link rel="alternate" to specify a feed. You can opt out - it will show the follow button but won't generate a feed.
<p>Yes we use WebSub at google to know when a feed is updated
