<p>my last for-profit job before becomeing CEO was bagging groceries at a thriftway
<p>I did this show for This American Life called The Giant Pool of Money on the economic crisis
<p>The same tools we are using to tell stories about heartbreak and love we can talk about exotic financial derivatives
<p>Planet Money became very successful - and showed that we could apply these skills across a range of stories
<p>I thought "this podcast thing could work" - I thought I learned I was good at business through the t-shirt project
<p>we made almost $600,000 and sold 25,000 t-shirts, so I thought "damn am I hot shit" - we're making money
<p>I love NPR and public media, but they're not the best business people in the world. I thought I could do better
<p>I thought the Startup podcast was going to be a publicity stunt, but it ended up as a suprisingly emotional journey
<p>I went to pitch <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/sacca">@sacca</a>, which is like just learning to paint and asking Jeff Koons for help
<p>why don't we use a foreign name, and we ended up in Esperanto - with 'Orello' - it's Ear in Esperanto
<p> the startup narrative often gets told in hindsight with all the bad bits cut out - I wanted to leave them in
<p>when you are deciding how to share out ownership, you have to pretend you have a big valuable company when you don't
<p>every time we put out an episode I thought people would turn on me and they'll realise that I'm an awful person
<p>but every time we did share the pain other people told us "I went through that too!"
<p>we ended up raising $1.5M in seed money and it wasonly  after the podcast went up we sealed the deal
<p>I thought I could go on my track record, but nobody got it. When I did it and it got attention it became an example
<p>I was explaining how I was going to make a narrative with pathos, and then I did it
<p>You are never going to able to explain the thing as well as you can by showing the thing
<p>Our revenue in the 1st year was $2m thanks to insanely high ad rates, but after <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/dooce">@dooce</a>'s talk we need another stream
<p>a year into it I am seeing things happen that I had no idea would happen. <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/PJVogt">@PJVogt</a> and <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/Agoldmund">@Agoldmund</a> came in early
<p>they kept coming up with new credits for Matt "Matt Lieber is a window in room where you didn't think there was one"
<p>[plays the beginning of <a class="auto-link" href="https://gimletmedia.com/episode/36-todays-the-day/">https://gimletmedia.com/episode/36-todays-the-day/</a> ] which is a great 4th wall breaking episode
<p>the reason we're all trying to start things is to make a place where things we hadn't imagined can grow

<p>like a lot people, I say "I don't know what I'm doing" when I'm asked what i do, and people agree with me
<p>the 1990s were the high water mark for comics, but all but one distributor collapsed 
<p>there was a boom in independent comics - independent is anything that isn't a guy in spandex with visible muscles
<p>but the one remaining distributor raised the minimum order size and wiped out all the indie comics
<p>but then webcomics happened, and the bar to entry went from very hight to really low
<p>when webcomics took off we were seen as line-jumpers, dilletantes, ushering in the death of the newspaper
<p>it felt kind of like trench warfare with webcomics and traditional publishing in separate lines
<p>and after years of trench warfare Kickstarter showed up and I thought "this is going to be amazing"
<p>I did a book a book called "poorcraft" based on how to get by when you are poor, 'cos with webcomics I knew about it
<p>people said "anyone who can raise $13,000 on kickstarter shouldn't be using kickstarter"
<p>I called it Iron Circus Comics because I already owned the domain,  and it was better than Invincible Dachshund 
<p>If you search for me on the internet you'll find my women's erotic comics anthology, Smut Peddler
<p>I thought "I like porn, I don't like any of the porn being made. Oh, I should make some porn"
<p>to be in Smut Peddler your comic needs to stress consent and mutual willingness. You'd think that was a low bar, but…
<p>to be in Smut Peddler there needs to be a woman involved - the writer, the artist or the colourist
<p>I got so much pushback on the woman thing, though I also got lots of creepy letters about the consent thing too
<p>Wow, I sure do sell a whole lot of stuff nobody wants. 
<p>Kickstarter then had the 'message the author' button right next to the "report this" one, so I got some odd messages
<p>This started a lot on kickstarter - this opened up the floodgates for support for other things
<p>I'm really into artists getting paid. You'd think that would be obvious, but not so
<p>I want to put things out there that I don't see - that I'm told people don't want.
<p>A New World is about your adventure being someone else's disaster
<p>there is a group that think their TV and comics and games ae under threat from people not like them
<p>there have always been black people and brown people and women and queers and trans in comics, we've always been here
<p>this is not a fight. It's over. We're here, we've always been here. if you have a problem with it I don't really care
<p>Comics was comfortable. Superhero stories in comic book shops and movies about men in tights is not all there is
<p>the goalposts for unprofessional keep moving all the time "that will never work" becomes "that doesn't count"
<p>You can sit on reddit or tumblr and say that my comics don't count, but you are literally, verifiably wrong

<p>In highschool I was the nerdy kid who wore a trenchcoat that someone had to ask out when he lost a bet
<p>I was in such a hurry to tell people in highschool that I wasn't like other girls - I was a "cool girls"
<p>I used the term "attention whore" like telegrams used the word "stop"
<p>if gamergate had happened several years ago and to someone else, I'd have been on the other side
<p>I would have been one of those useful idiots who mkaes up hate mobs
<p>Can we stop using the word Trolling it's Abuse. Trolling is a thing you can do to a friend, and still be friends
<p>we end up playing a game of Schrödingers Murderer every time - is some hot topic kid or Dylan Roof?
<p>Most people participating in online harassment think they're the good guys
<p>they all have a secret conspiracy theory that you are secretly rich so they can still be the underdog 
<p>There are a lot of things to be found in a mob, but justice isn't one of them
<p>I talked to 300 former trollsand asked why they stopped, they said someone they looked up to said it wasn't cool
<p>Another thing that got the trolls backing off is humanising the target, not making them a caricature
<p>when my phone would ring, I'd answer it and they would say "Is this Zoë Quinn?" "yes" "oh. I'm sorry"
<p>It's not really about the target, it's about belonging to the group that si attacking
<p>If you look over to where the comments are on this video you'll see "she is evil! Boobs!" (I paraphrase)
<p>More people would rather tell people that they had committed a misdemeanor than to mental health treatment
<p>my biggest harassers use their real names and build a brand to raise money for attacking me
<p>We need tech platforms to step up here, we should be ahead of this
<p>don't get mad at the toddler who crashed your car, but the adult that gave them the keys
<p>I've admitted to a lot today.You have a picture of me in fedora now, m'lady
<p>consider if you are criticising someone's actions or shitting on someone as a person
<p>No single snowflake feels responsible for the avalanche that crashes down on people
<p>Don't be a snowflake in someone else's avalanche.

<p>I started out on the web when it looked like this [screenshot of Mosaic browser]
<p>this was the days of gopher, which was like a BBS on steroids
<p>I wrote a tutorial on how to write HTML, and 4 million people learned from it, and I got no ad revenue for it
<p>when CSS came out I made a support grid for the 2 browsers that implemented it, and were very different
<p>back in the 1990s I started writing little notes on my homepage. We were bloggers once and young.
<p>I used to write the HTMl by hand, but then I got smart and used custom XML and handmade XSLTscript
<p>It was natural to me when my 5 year old daughter Rebecca was diagnosed with brain cancer, to write about it
<p>I wanted anyone who came by later to understand what they weer going through
<p>I kept up until I had to post her obituary 9 months later.
<p>My web developer friends got a hashtag trending #663399Becca on the day of her funeral
<p>There  was a proposal to add a colour to CSS calling #663399 "Becca Purple" - I said use RebeccaPurple
<p>there is now a memorial to my daughter in the CSS spec I work with all the time. I can't process this.
<p>What pushed me to think about RebeccaPurple again was gamergate that blew up into many attacks on women
<p>as a very part time gamer I felt like I was looking at this from the outside, and I stepped back to analyse it
<p>I saw I was seeing something very similar to the #663399Becca campaign here
<p>That same process was happening - a hashtag as a memetic hook as a way to organise a group to do something
<p>we can look at this in terms of the bad input, but it not just that. It is also the medium this happens in
<p>the medium is not neutral to it's uses - even a road is not neutral, as where it is built affects who uses it
<p>roads are not free-for-alls  - we set rules on how people use them and even license people to drive on them
<p>I am not advocating licensing people to use the internet, tempting as that would be sometimes
<p>what we do, what we value affects how the world works, how society changes over the next generations
<p>what our children see online is what they will think is normal
<p>software is eating the world, but we shape it. What we make easy shows what we value
<p>to paraphrase Brillat-Saverin: show me what you build and I will show you what you are
<p>League of Legends was known for having toxic communications - they tested the design to reduce this toxisicy
<p>The game ECO is a planetary simulator where players battle pollution adn extinction by an asteroid
<p>with our designs and with the things that we build there has not been much said about the values they encourage
<p>if we build networks where it is easy to harass, that is how it becomes the expected norm
<p>if networks make mounting those attacks more difficult, the ability to mute or block may be unnnecessary
<p>as there is no truly meaningful distinction between online and offline, the online behaviour will determine the offline
<p>we are building like crazy; we need to build wisely
<p>I ask you to do this not in Rebecca's name, but in the name of her brother and sister who will have to live with it
