    <div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://about.me/herbkim'>Herb Kim</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Welcome to the 9th startup competition - we used to say Annual, but that's not quite right any more. 12 startups get to pitch for 3 minutes each
    </blockquote></div>
    <div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href=''>Base Pace</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm Will, cofounder of Base Pace and we want to make fitness easier for everyone. Fitness knowledge is either hard to find or trivial
    <p>We're creating personalised adaptive training programmes powered by AI - we gather lots of data and tune per user
    <p>we want to harness events like the Great North Run to give athletes and runners a better experience and healthier training
    <p>we're PhD Students from University of Newcastle who have been rowing for years and are testing with Newcastle Uni personal trainers
    <p>q: revenue model? - a: subscription service and white label apps, with a % of subscription - revenue for race organisers too
    <p>q: uniqueness? a: others are static, we're adaptive to injuries or other life events. There are other AI co's but linking with events should spread more
    </blockquote></div>
    <div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://bibliosoft.co.uk'>Biblio Limited</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>James Hanson, co founder of Biblio - we are digitising certification management for offshore and renewable energy
    <p>certification at the moment is spreadsheets and paper or pdf certs - we want a dat trail from the trainers to learners to employers
    <p>we want to create a much more usable dataset to create efficiencies compared o the current setup - this hasn't happened as it is an addon
    <p>Offshore Renewable is the fastest growing industry in the UK, and there is a high risk if certification is not correct
    <p>Wind engineers alone spend £2000/year on training and certification
    <p>we're a spin out of Layers Studio - me and Paula Donnelly
    <p>q: you're not delivering training, just certification? a: currently it is done through spreadsheets and printing, we digitise it
    <p>q: how do you get them to trust you? a: we are looking into security solutions - we looked at Blockchain but that may just be a trend
    <p>There are digital certs already, but not integrated into the process, so adoption is low
    </blockquote></div>
    <div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.dresscircle.co.uk'>Dress Circle</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We all have that friend we go to to ask what show should I see? I have been that friend. We made a web page, but then a website for friends to rate shows too
    <p>we took all the information we got, and compared the ratings to see what the best show is, and tailor it to the individual 
    <p>we then built a calendar to track what you have seen and to recommend shows based on that
    <p>
    <p>we can track when shows move venues, and when performers or directors move to another show for further recommendations
    <p>we have data on all shows back to 1937 - IMDB for UK Theatre
    <p>q: just musicals? a: musicals, dance and plays - not comedy and music. Do we go outside UK, or add in music and comedy next?
    <p>revenue is partly ticket sales, but also data for shows to target tours as we know where fans are of previous productions, and can go to amateur too
    <p>1-10% of ticket sales on bigger shows, advertising for smaller venues too
    </blockquote></div>
    <div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://globalteacher.co'>Global Teacher</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Chris design engineer and founder of Global teacher - currently 15% of the world population - 1Bn people 
    <p>1Bn people don't have internet, and we're shipping printed textbooks to these people.

    <p>We spent £20k of our £30k startup funding to get ISO certification, and that led to a £20k/mo contract
    <p>we saw that businesses suck at information security - no-one likes Cyber and they fear a guy in a hoodie will steal your data and get you fined
    <p>there are 200k UK businesses needing this - fintech and more
    <p>q: are you a consultancy or a product? a: core product is certifications such as ISO - you don't need a consultant, though you do need an audit 90% software 10% consulting
    <p>you need to be audited and certified every year so it is recurring revenue
    </blockquote></div>

    <p>How do you know which networking events to go to? People have chosen based on whether there is free booze and a buffet
    <p>I have built a SaaS platform to tell you which events are right for you - there are 200-300 events at any given time 
    <p>it launched last year, and we're enabling you to follow event hosts, topics and themes so you don't miss valuable opportunites

    <p>q: revenue? a: subscription model - £150/year as personal advice given- also online courses too; will do a monthly sub for automated
    <p>q: Global teacher who sponsors a pod? a: anyone could do that, but we're targetting corporates and philanthropists - we have 100 so far
    </blockquote></div>
    <div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.hicomply.com'>Hicomply</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>q: hicomply, how do you generate the documentation? a: we have a document merge tool based on pre-written templates tuned for each company. 
    <p>q: are you cheaper than a consultant? a: about the same, but the consultants get to do advice rather than boilerplate
    </blockquote></div>
