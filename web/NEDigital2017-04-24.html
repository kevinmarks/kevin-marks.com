<p>changing the mentality is key - businesses have processes for everything but marketing, where they have campaigns 
<p>when you make it a process, it happens every day, so when a customers falls into a bucket they get the message
<p>a lot of people want data that they don't need, so we incentivise them to get rid of it
<p>importing data is horrible—when people make spreadsheets they are totally inconsistent. with integration it gets better

<p>real rider had a lot of ideas about what the app should do, but we did user testing to check these
<p>realrider were reluctant to build a social network, but the users really wanted to connect to each other
<p>we show the users the feature navigation and get them to rate it, and then keep the green and eliminate the red
<p>we record everything the test users do, so it's not just the feedback but how they try to use it too

<p>artificial intelligence is this kind of transition that will change things
<p>now AI sounds like killer robots, but we're already using it in spam filters, Spotify playlists and so on
<p>if we do make artificial general AI, it could take off as soon as we make it - from 2 year old to godlike in a day
<p>we don't have general AI, we have lots of little local Ads - an internet of AI things
<p>AI has moved from disappointing to disruptive because we now have parallel computation and some new algorithms
<p>when we taught computers to read we got google; what will we get when we teach them to see?
<p>we have taught them to listen too - speech recognition now lives in Alexa and so on, but ti will be omnipresent soon
<p>Get AI ready - use AI to improve customer experience, to assist your workforce
<p>AI could affect everyone from insurance to GPs to truck drivers - we want to assist people not replace them
<p>Start planning now - it may not solve your problems yet, but think how it could replace you
