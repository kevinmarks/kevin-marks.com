<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://read.acloud.guru'>Drew Firment</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I was mapping cost efficiency vs architectural optimisation - not the axes in Simon's maps
<p>ask yourself "does what I'm spending time on matter?" rebooting servers, updating versions - no-one cares - serverless means you have no-ops
<p>we have 600k customers, 6.5M lambda invocations daily, and costs $550/month for serverless fees

<p>Maps can be a boundary object - just structured enough to maintain a common identity, but interpreted differently across communities
