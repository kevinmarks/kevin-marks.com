<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.privacypractice.co.uk/'>James Leaton Gray</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the GDPR fines have got boardroom attention, when those of us wittering on about data for years has been ignored
<p>The GDPR stopping you using your marketing database without new consent is much more significant than potential fines
<p>Data Protection legislation is principles based - it does not tell you exactly what to do
<p>we are used to asking all sorts of questions and not being sure how we use it - even now vendors are selling databases that can't be updated
<p>GDPR extends the data protection principles - now must be Fair, Lawful and Transparent too. Most systems are not transparent at all.
<p>The other new principle in GDPR over Data Protection is Accountability - you now need to show your working
<p>Transparency means that you need to tell people why you are collecting the data, how long you'll keep it, what you will use it for, and explain it in clear language, not legalese
<p>The data access rights mean that you need to enable people to correct and erase data you hold on them, and export it
<p>if you use the right to erasure, you will also be take off the marketing suppression list, so you will get untargeted marketing
<p>Data Portability is a bit of a red herring - it was there to encourage building a European social network, but network effects mean there will be no-one there
<p>the broadcasters are under pressure from new short form interactions, and we want to keep them in long form
<p>I can see an advantage in being able to move your preferences between iPlayer and ITV
<p>GDPR is still platform neutral, but it is still very mainframe shaped with controllers and processors
<p>Consent is not specifically defined to be 'freely given' meaning it can be withdrawn. It also needs to be affirmative, so no default checked checkboxes
<p>what we need to get to is Privacy by Default - we get there through Privacy by Design, after doing a Data Protection impact assessment
<p>The public sector already has data breach mandatory reporting - this is new for the private sector and needs planning for
<p>There is data everywhere, we are swimming in it and we don't always notice when a bit goes missing. We now need to know that.
<p>The Journalism exemption to GDPR is a bit of a tricky boundary - do comments on articles count?
<p>marketing our programmes is not covered by a journalism exemption
<p>As media we are used to people talking to us - we ask for comments and get them. In the longer term will media want to talk to them more?
<p>as we move from broadcasting to more personalised streams, we need information about them to provide that personalisation
<p>as companies have to send out GDPR marketing reconsent emails, they are having to give consumer s incentives to sign up again 
<p>people are realising that they need an intermediary between them and news or information, but it no longer is our media organisations
<p>some media companies are asking "do we need this inaccurate data from adtech? could we do it ourselves?"
<p>what media have to do is Transparenccy: records of processing, where the data is, how it flows, retention schedules, breach notifications
<p>we have seen trust in online services drop over the last 10 years - if we want trust we need to be transparent
<p>very few organisations have data accuracy and quality processes built in - this needs to chain with mandated transparency
<p>we did an experiment with iPlayer to use viewing habits to create recommendations - when we asked viewers about it they assumed it was personalised already, not editorial
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.golantmediaventures.com'>Patrick Towell</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>5 years ago we looked at what happened if you recommended from video to music or vice versa - we found we need more data to cross media
<p>we worked with an energy company to rewrite terms and conditions into plain English so that people could measurably understand them
<p>this meant rewriting the conditions to narrate the user journey - no longer organised by category
<p>freely given and informed consent is not about plain English, it's about remodelling the user journey so that it is understandable
<p>there are many companies that are accidental publishers - they end up publishing information to customers without haviing a journalism practice
<p>companies have to look at the risks of not being trusted - of taking personalisation too far
<p>if your personalised it wasn't a welcome surprise unless you explained how it happened - we gave a semantic breadcrumb trail
<p>now netflix and amazon say recommending this because you watched that - explaining mitigates this
<p>the gold standard for personalisation is Songkick - we want that delight when we get the email
<p>Johan Naughton at Prospect magazine calls it the Web of Spies: <a class="auto-link" href="https://pocketmags.com/prospect-magazine/feb-18/articles/302763/web-of-spies">https://pocketmags.com/prospect-magazine/feb-18/articles/302763/web-of-spies</a>
<p>"Bitcoin Services, formerly known as Tulip BioMed, saw its stock increase by as much as 42,500% last year." <a class="auto-link" href="https://qz.com/1175701/putting-bitcoin-or-blockchain-in-a-company-name-is-sometimes-enough-for-a-pop-on-the-stock-market/">https://qz.com/1175701/putting-bitcoin-or-blockchain-in-a-company-name-is-sometimes-enough-for-a-pop-on-the-stock-market/</a>
<p>some of the powers the ICO have could stop your business dead if you can no longer process customer data
<p>making data transparent should build trust; you need to redesign services around people so you can explain it to them
<p>in order to fulfil a personal access request you need to join up all your systems that track them - a reason to connect your systems
<p>"Marketing is just joining people up with the stuff they love" - not a broadcast view
<p>thinking of the questions that you want to ask shoudl drive the data that you shoudl collect
<p>personal data and customer relationships are not assets in themselves, only in conjunction with a documented legal basis to use it
<p>you need to convince your customers that they rae in control of their data, you hold it temporarily and they can revoke your access

<p>We need to reinvent the BBC for a new generation - we are looking at automation of almost verything
<p>my job is to understand how audiences are changing - moving from a broadcast model to a public service organisation: targetted universality
<p>moving from The BBC to My BBC needs us to have data to understand our audience and to improve their experience
<p>Our new identity system, the BBC account was launched in September 2016 - we ask for age, postcode and gender for adults, birthdate and town for children
<p>knowing age, postcode and gender helps us with our mission of universality.
<p>there was an argument that we could infer demography from programme watching, but then it is not verified, just assumed
<p>we are very transparent with our audiences about how we use their data and explain why in language they understand
<p>we have bene pushing people towards sign-in - we put iPlayer behind sign-in with 2 no's -  now 55% on iPlayer. 13% BBC Sport 11% BBC News
<p>we have about 10 million people signed in a week, with over 25 million accounts
<p>we now have an assumption of sign-in for products, and need a good reason why not
<p>we have a pan-BBC steering group across legal, infosec, production, engineering and marketing to cover GDPR
<p>we now have a data inventory that has allowed us to track where data is used
<p>Data Minimisation is quite a challenge - it's nice to be able to say 'you've been signed in for 10 years, here is what you have seen' - there is user value there

</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/insidethebbc/managementstructure/biographies/north_nick'>Nick North</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we did have the Box Set approach over Christmas where we showed older series - this is not always true and we are reviewing those windows
<p>we store personal data in lots of different places - bbc news contact forms, audience tickets, iplayer - having to deliver against an access request makes this difficult
<p>some of the larger global suppliers are not gdpr compliant - or they are trying to charge extra for European storage - a lot of contract renegotiation
<p>Data can be hard to explain - people tend to find it boring. If you make it too simple, it looks like your hiding something; if you explain the details it is dull.
<p>GDPR is an opportunity, not a threat: there is a willingness to share data, but also a distrust of storing it
<p>the right ot portability gives a chance for customers to make better use of their data - across media industry or as a public service
<p>we're talking to news media and broadcast media to come together and explore what next steps might be
<p>the principle of the bbc account is the more that we know you better, the better we can serve you. This only works if we collaborate wih hothers
<p>we're looking at the practicalities of building an open API so that we can export data, so we need data standards so that it is understandable, and timeley
<p>our subject access requests are 30 days now - thats not helpful for viewing information
<p>the list of what has been seen is one thing, but if there is descriptive data its more useful - we're looking at format and standards of metadata for this richer data
<p>the other key thing around this is security standards - we want the event level media viewing data to be secured fuly
<p>we're thinking about how people can benefit from their personal data, and personal data stores
<p>we're seeing data donation services and open data exchanges being launched and tarcking them
<p>this opens up questions about digital identity management, privacy and about social exclusion of the less connected
<p>we need to think about a federated identity system, as this may be an inevitable consequence of  portability
<p>often we are very reliant on our customer base for a level of quality - how do we know they are who hey say they are 
<p>I want to move beyond compliance into opportunity

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.adunity.com/'>Rupert Graves</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Programmatic advertising is all about data - brands by ad media from publishers, but there is a giant mesh of data brokers, media agencies, ad buying and selling tech
<p>thee can be 20 or 30 entities involved in delivering a single ad, which I think is insane
<p>Programmatic advertising is supposed to provide "better performance" of advertising
<p>if the publisher is the data controller, they can segment their audience and sell the higher valued ones, but segmentation reduces scale
<p>If adtech is the data controller, they are buying low from the publisher, then segmenting themselves and selling high to advertisers
<p>because the publisher can't sell direct they end up selling more ads, as they're getting less per ad
<p>the biggest players in the industry own the narrative and don't explain this arbitrage

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.adunity.com/'>Rupert Graves</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the question is who is the controller, so who is doing the segmentation?
<p>Normally the agency will give you a tag to run in your site, or you set up a deal ID and the ad gets to the users browser, so they still get IP address and cookie
<p>42 billion spent on digital advertising tin the EU
<p>There is a lot of legislation affecting advertising in the EU - the Digital Content Contracts Directive will require data handling be in the contract
<p>3rd aprty cookies on your site makes you a de facto joint profit making enterprise - misuse of personal information is a tort - see Vidal-Hall vs Google
<p>we are advising publishers to work on a contract basis with end users

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.privacypractice.co.uk/'>James Leaton Gray</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>does that imply a signed-in experience for the publisher?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.adunity.com/'>Rupert Graves</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>this applies to sites where you are making money from selling advertising: you would need to get consent for the ad providers
<p>we think that where you are asking for consent for ad tech players, they will struggle to get it, as no-one wants to be retargeted
<p>under GDPR you need consent for the facebook like button they use to track you

</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.adunity.com/'>Rupert Graves</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>typically people think the publisher is responsible for the ads, not the middleware ad providers - when you give consent is it delegatable?
<p>I think GDPR will help publishers by making these relationships more explicit and less hidden from consumers
<p>GDPR locks down the data that brands have about their customers
<p>we think you can change publishers to connect the publisher as data processor to the brand (who has consent from the customer)
<p>we store an identifier of the consent which is not PII, and combine that with an ad campaign
<p>there are ad providers putting out bogus data processing agreements
<p>because you can now withdraw consent, mistaken consent (someone else in household) can be revoked

<p>the ICO is looking into compliance tools around AI and machine learning that combine lots of data without easy auditing
<p>the BSI have standards like BS 10012-2017 which may help move to GDPR compliance

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://ctrl-shift.co.uk'>William Kemble-Clarkson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the digital economy having dat dispersed across silos was useful at first, but blending data between silos is adding new value now
<p>just as you . need to manage fish stocks and not over deplete it, the UK data economy needs data stocks management too
<p>GDPR was conceived as a way to ensure future data in the economy is useful. 75% is existing models of Data Protection
<p>the new parts are grounds for processing and subject data rights
<p>Users now need to go on new consent journeys to be marketed at - the best we have managed is 34%; one of the most trusted brands in the UK got 17%
<p>it's not the regulations - the regulation is forcing us to have a transparent conversation about marketing, and people don't want to be marketed at
<p>we don't just see this in research, we see it in user behaviour - 35% of users in europe have ad blockers on desktop - this is a huge consumer protest
<p>Keith Weed of Unilever has said that consumers are sick of seeing the same ads over and over, and the role of funding fake news and worse
<p>Ije Nwokone of Wolff Olins says the Internet promised the marketing golden age, but only made us a slave to the funnel and killed customer relationships
<p>traditional industrial work is to make a uniform product and market it to as many different segments as possible
<p>for the last 6 or 7 years, digital advertising promised every cheaper customers, we got hooked on metrics rather than long tail value creation
<p>the opportunity is to rebuild the relationship with customers so that you are creating value for them, so they want to give you more information to help
<p>you need to think about Customer RoI - what they get out of each interaction with you
<p>if you use data to unlock value and build trust, this can be a virtuous spiral
<p>we see a new commercial model- Me2B 
<p>GDPR is a bit of a pain, but the upside of the potential is there
<p>we need to think of information as a personal asset, not a coporate asset and build 2 way data flows between customers and businesses
<p> a way to rethink this is brands as information services
<p>our early research is showing that we won't get the customer consent we want until we change our businesses
<p>Don't wait for a class action suit - transform your business to reflect GDPR first
