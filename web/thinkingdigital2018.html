<p>Some older people have been speaking with their radios for a long time - now with Alexa the radio can answer back
<p>as of 2 weeks ago, we have launched Alexa skills for Kids in the UK and Germany - you need shorter prompts, continuous feedback and simpler words
<p>a favourite skill of mine is Kids Court that turns Alexa into a judge for children's disputes
<p>This is Maura - she's my friends grandmother. She skipped the mobile generation, but she can use Alexa straight away.
<p>the bbc team prototyped their Alexa skills by having scripts for people talking to each other

<p>In 2017 the OED chose word of the year as "youthquake" - though later research showed that Corbyn's yourthquake didn't bring all the votes to the yard
<p>In 2015 the OED chose the crying with laughter emoji as word of the year - it was 20% of UK emoji that year, though usage has fallen off over the last year
<p>60 million emoji are used a day on facebook, but 5 billion are used daily on facebook messenger
<p>I'm from Goldsmith's University in London, researching in Human Computer Interaction - previously I've worked on medical devices and immersive theatre
<p>more recently this has meant researching emoji
<p>when my friend finally bought her house, I responded with 🎏🎏🎏carp streamers - I then realised that this was only a celebratory emoji for me and my sister
<p>Just as 2 people can listen to the same audio clip and one hear Yanny and the other Laurel, they can look at the same emoji and see a different meaning
<p>U+1F351 Peach was changed 🍑to look less clefty - 73% of the time peach is used to mean buttocks, and apple ruined sexting
<p>aubergine and peach repurposing have become a universal thing
<p>🕵️‍♀️teenagers are now using emoji with secret meanings
<p>💀➡️🔥 can mean "I hope you die in a fire" according to Fox News
<p>I ran a study last year to see if me and my sister were weird for using carp streamers for a secret meaning, and found lots of repurposing
<p>mostly people repurpose faces, animals and food especially with their romantic partners
<p>🐙octopus was most used to mean hugs or other things… and 🐧penguin was used as a pet name most often
<p>🐐was used to mean 'horny' and 👹was used for sex as it was unsexy
<p>some people repurposed bath 🛀as coffin as there was no coffin emoji at the time⚰️
<p>a lot of emoji were repurposed because of shared history, some by sound 🎩💩for Hatchet (their pub)
<p>people used food to mean I love you - 🍕or 🧀
<p>sending 🐻says a lot without having to find words
<p>Humans don't understand emoji yet, so be extra careful when you teach a machine to understand emoji

<p>I now have a new sense - I feel the seismic motion of the planet in real time
<p>I was a dancer, and we were encouraged to use technology in our dance pieces - I wanted this to be more natural and feel more
<p>I first had sensors on my earring to detect motion of people near me, but I wanted to feel the planet moving instead
<p>witht his seismic sense I now feel that I have 2 heartbeats, I used to wake up in the night if there was a big quake, now it is . a background sense
<p>the seismic sense is an artwork, but I am the only audience for it - the performance is inside my body. I experience the art, and I find ways to share it
<p>I do a  performance called "waiting for an earthquake" where I dance based on the movements of the earth =- sometimes we have to wait for a while until it happens
<p>last year I helped found the Cyborg foundation to help people become cyborgs, to promote cyborg arts and to defend peoples rights to modify themselves
<p>we have also founded the transpecies society  - we shouldn't be scared of evolving beyond the human
<p>Neil and I have bad teeth . I have one tooth missing, he has 2. we had implants that could click in each others mouths, which we use fro morese code
<p>the messaging was using the bluetooth protocol, so it was a bluetooth tooth 
<p>my firend has barometric ears - he can feel the air pressure directly with his ears
<p>we don't do virtual reality, we do revealed reality
<p>I now want to have implants the reflect earthquakes on the moon

<p>we've seen blockchain compared to the internet - giving access to the economy the way the internet gave access to information
<p>blockchain is simply a database, but everyone shares the same data, everyone agrees on the data, no-one can change the data
<p>you can trust data in the blockchain, even if you don't trust the person who put it there [I don't think you understand GIGO]
<p>any electronic transaction has about 12  parties involved and about a third of the cost of commerce is spent on keeping track of this
<p>about a million people a year die from taking fake pharmaceutical products - tracking supply chains is vital
<p>blockchain can give a certified supply chain all the way back to the original farmer who grew the product [how is this immune to forgery?]
<p>Is this stuff real? The answer is yes and no.
<p>Bitcoin works - if you break Bitcoin you walk away with $70bn [no you don't, you make it disappear. The incentive is to hide the problems]
<p>we can see a future where you don't have passports, and your travel is recorded immediately on the blockchain [surveillance is your friend]

<p>I want to talk about data, but people are overloaded with cambridge analytica, facebook and GDPR, but it isn't all bad
<p>we don't hear about the good stuff with data, we hear about shrining civic spaces and mass surveillance, but ti can be used for good
<p>Voice recordings can be analysed to help cure parkinsons, contributing to open street map can help tackle inequality and fight diseases
<p>I'm particularly interested in how the natural world has become a stream of data that shapes our lives
<p>I use data as an art material. It becomes something flexible and malleable and manipulable - all the things you can't do if it is on a blockchain
<p>data can be used in many ways, because we interpret data to tell our own stories
<p>Naked mole rats are incredible - they can survive without oxygen for 18 minutes, and have huge frnt teeth that can be moved independently like chopsticks, and they don't get cancer
<p>we have a data feed that shows us where the naked mole rats are all the time, and see who patorls where - the queen patrols 3 times as far as the other mole rats
<p>this is real time feed of the animal data that controls different variables in the animation
<p>I like to set up the systems and pour data into them without full control over how it displays
<p>I made a soft robotics visualiser that maps data to flexible objects with a smooth and fluid body language
<p>when people go on safari and photograph elephants, they are leaking the geolocation on social media and helping poachers find the elephants. We need data privacy for animals

<p>the goal is to make an e-skin that can be used in robotics and later apply it to humans
<p>if you go to a car factory, the robots are kept in cages to protect human workers from injury
<p>we want future robots to work side by side with humans in our daily lives, not in cages - there is physical contact between man and machine
<p>if there is physical contact then how things feel is important
<p>could a wheelchair be connected with soft robotics so you can feel through it?
<p>we want humanoid robots, but so far they don't have a sense of touch, so we need to make robotic skin
<p>skin over all our bodies is important because that gives a sense of motion to the whole being, not just fingertips
<p>we take a silicon wafer that is about 500 micrometres thick and etch it down to 10 µm to make it flexible
<p>we built a flexible sensor that can attach to human skin, and give a direct reading of pH of the sweat which correlates with blood glucose

<p>if you want to become a new thing, start telling people you are that thing
<p>I made an advent calendar with 25 people wearing clothes that you could scratch off with a coin
<p>it is quite hard to find naked pictures of normal people on the internet, I don't know if you have ever searched for "naked picture"
<p>for last year I crowd sourced people to be in the advent calendar  and 258 people wanted to be photographed naked
<p>3 kinds - exhibitionists, fans of my work, and people who want a challenge int their lives, and have a 'fuck it' moment
<p>i wanted a mixture of different people and body types, so I followed the 258 people and looked at their body types
<p>the great thing about doing an advent calendar is that all december you get great free marketing on social media for a product than can never be bought again
<p>find me on the internet if you want to be in it this year
<p>my website is my name: mr.bingo

<p>when measuring visual perception, I realised that we don't know enough about how sleep is regulated by the brain
<p>Sleep is an essential innate behaviour - babies don't have to learn it from adults
<p>when 3 ducks sleep in a row, the centre duck closes both eyes and the outer ducks keep one eye open
<p>Yang Dan: the 2 big questions are "Why do we sleep?" and "How is sleep controlled"
<p>we have measured memory consolidation in sleep, and also clear up metabolic waste products
<p>we know that both REM and non-REM sleep are controlled by differernt parts of the brain
<p>the brain really looks like a bowl of spaghetti - it's very difficult to separate the chains of neurons
<p>we have found wake neurons that we can stimulate with light to wake them up
<p>the ultimate goal is to be abel to turn sleep on and off on demand

<p>I was the first person to be in charge of growth in music at twitter, and before that I was in charge of artists social on disney
<p>I learned html on mspace becasue I wanted to make my profile look better
<p>it's ironic to me that we now need to say in meetings "laptops down" so that people pay attention to the meeting that they are in

<p>we had a trip to the grand canyon, and I whined "what are we going to do at the grand canyon?" The debate guy said "stare at the hole"
<p>I am a failure at mindfulness - we need to be in social networks all the time these days and don't switch off

<p>thinking digital is not about using computers more, it's about using clocks less
<p>mechanical clocks over the last 500 years have transformed our personality. That is finally changing, thanks to computers
<p>we used to have an appointment wiht the TV, now we binge watch instead [yep <a class="auto-link" href="http://epeus.blogspot.co.uk/2006/01/live-tv-is-dead-and-were-noticing.html">http://epeus.blogspot.co.uk/2006/01/live-tv-is-dead-and-were-noticing.html</a> ]
<p>we used to spend all our time being interrupted by each other using telephones - now we don't , we just text instead
<p>we used to all wear watches with clocks, to events notifying on our phones
<p>the greeks had 2 personifications of time - Chronos who was longitudinal time and his symbol was a scythe; Chryros was the opportune moment in time, his symbol was the scales
<p>Wells invented one kind of time travel story, but Virginia Woolf invented the stream of consciousness narrative in time
<p>Woolf's Mrs Dalloway has characters interrupted by Big Ben - Chronos interrupting Chyros. Woolf claimed we went on the clock in 1810
<p>we had city-wide time in the 19th C and country wide thanks to trains in 1880s, and in 1930s we had electric grid synchronised time
<p>we had radio synchronised time in the 1940s, and now atomic clocks in orbit on GPS synchronising time in the 1980s
<p>just as Chronos got perfect time, we got off the clock - Saturn (Chronos) ate his children but one escaped - Zeus and got his children back
<p>Ray Cummings in 1920 said "Time is what stops everything happening at once"
<p>Ursula Le Guin has 2 kind of time - an internal time that is personal and cyclical, but an external chronological time of history
<p>The cathedral in Ulm was only 5% taller than the great pyramid, but the Burj Khalifa is 5 times as tall
<p>this was possible because of reinforced cocnrete and elevators and air conditioning; what is that for time?
<p>Philip K Dick: Reality is that which doesn't go away when you stop believing it - but his characters could always escape reality into their own minds
<p>a man was so upset when Trump won, that he retreated from reality so he never reads the news and asks no-one to tell him about it
<p>if you want to create your own reality by crafting your information reality, that takes a lot of work 
<p>if you don't manage it, you will end up where Bruce Sterling and William Gibson describe: atemporality
<p>binge watching is atemporality run amok where you lose a day to another linear timestream
<p>Between 1910 and 2007 we had Chronos dominant, now Kairos is back in charge

<p>I was called a flat earther in the context of HCI - there were 3: command line; the GUI era, the Touch era, which we are in. This is flat earth computing- input and output are both in 2d
<p>Life isn't lived in 2 dimensions, we move in 3 dimensions. Who made a 2d picture in the last week? Everyone. Who has made a 3D one - almost nobody
<p>3D is still too hard. We now have gltf - "the jpeg of 3d" for transmitting and loading 3d models
<p>we have a free tool in windows that makes it easier to create 3D models - we've been building 3d fiels into windows 10 and our other tools
<p>we are focused on mixed reality now - not going into VR and hiding the world, but Hololens that puts 3d content into the real world
<p>I can drag a hologram into the real world, but it won't let me drop it through the floor or wall

<p>Rian Johnson had very clear ideas of what he wanted to make - we wanted as many in camera effects as possible, but we had 1850 VFX 200 prod fixes and 400 digital makeups
<p>4 ILM studios & over 10 external VFX comapnies working on it too
<p>We lost Carrie during the film, and we did not have to do any VFX jiggery pokery - she shot all her scenes
<p>We built an entire set for the Jedi Village on Sybil Head - we expected rain, but it was incredibly sunny so we had to wet the set oursleves
<p>Snoke's ship is 100km wide, which is now the record for biggest spaceship made.
<p>we built practical bombs and a real mechanised gun turret with CNC
<p>we 3d printed draft models, then the art director hand-painted them; we also get artists to paint over 3d models in photoshops
<p>there is a subtle aesthetic to the Star Wars world - the space ships all have to look lived in and real
<p>we simulate all of the explosions with physics- we set up bombs and gases and model the interior so we can see bits fall apart. we blew up all the ships we modelled
<p>we had a super cool black ship that was amazing, but you put it in front of space and you can't see it…
<p>I used to make puppets and I still love all of that - we made animatronic heads for the guardians 
<p>we didn't want to do a digital Yoda - we built a perfect replica of the original Yoda puppet and was performed practically
<p>we had practical Porg perfromers which meant a lot of green screen to remove
<p>with the Fathier creatures we had to decide whether it was canine, equine or feline and we modelled it all 3 ways to work out how to make them move
<p>and once we had animated it we built the 3d rig fro them to ride and drove it with servos to match
<p>Andy Serkis was Snoke, and he needed to interact with the actors, despite being 25 feet tall
<p>Phasma is a nightmare because she reflects everything - you can see the crew on their phones waiting for the shot, bits of ceiling so we had to replace it all
<p>we looked at particle accelerators and magnesium ribbons and made the intensely super white and made it monochrome
<p>Sorry I ran so long - I could do this for hours
