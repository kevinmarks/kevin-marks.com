<p>John Borthwick put out a call for <a href="https://render.betaworks.com/thinkcamp-a-betaworks-accelerator-program-for-tools-for-thinking-de7e18bf5682">Tools for Thinking</a>:
<blockquote><p>People want better tools for thinking — ones that take the mass of notes that you have and organize them, that help extend your second brain into a knowledge or interest graph and that enable open sharing and ownership of the “knowledge blobs” you create. Entrepreneurs are cracking open the category and building these new tools.</blockquote>

        <p>we have access to all this information, but we don't have access to great tools to make meaning out of , which is why I think we need better tootls for thinking.. We are forming our minds to be mass consumers and not great thinkers
        <p>The moment we are in is also important. We have seen a lot of development of graph databases and machine learning, and with web3 we could have data owned by everyone and shared across apps
        <p>We're starting to see more semantic spatial work begin, and I think we're going to see UI to make this work better
        <p>We need to think hard about how different people think. I first thought of tools as memorisation tools, but I never went back to them. I went back to pen and paper because the associative function was more important than the memoty
        <p>I find that going for a walk and going to sleep will often find a new association for me. Let me hand over to Jerry, who has two brains

        <p>this is the same file I opened in december 1997, and there is a half million of these 'thoughts' in the mindmap - I'm like the guy who made the palace of fine arts out of toothpicks
        <p>Raise your hand if you thought that HyperCard could have been the web, but Apple was stupid
        <p>Most people use mappy tools for mindmaps etc - there are lots of these - what i want to show you is someone using one of these tools for himself
        <p>How can we make a social memory so everyone can use their favourite tool, but connect between them? [km webmention!]
        <p>By putting things into this tool, I have improved my recall because by adding 'thoughts' to this brain, which helps remind me of connections between them
        <p>how do we connect these tools? our datasets are all siloed, we need a bonfire in the middle to share around
        <p>If we do this right we can help make better decisions as a society, and we are in 5 simultaneous crises right now
        <p>The web is stuck in Web 1.0 language- ideas go into books or PDFs, so we can't connect them well

        <p>when societies first became complex we had a sense making crisis, we have another one now with the climate crisis
        <p>we need to get off the collapse trajectory and onto the sustainability trajectory or the go to space one
        <p>we have all these great tools for thought, but apps trap thoughts in SaaS silos - the same origin security model causes this
        <p>each app lives in it's own pocket universe by default, and you often need bizdev to connect them which is no way to scale
        <p>we need a protocol for thought - what if you could draw knowledge form anywhere and connect them together, like Xanadu
        <p>we're building <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/noosphere-a-protocol-for-thought">Noosphere</a>, a world-wide knowledge graph - permissionless, decentralized over IPFS, user owned and multiplayer, belonging in to everyone
        <p>It's like HTTP - belongs to everyone [so use HTTP - km]
        <p>you get cross-app transclusions and back links, change history, and user owned back pack, and Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe
        <p>libp2p from IPFS - we have p2p petnames, versioning like lightweight git, and signing with a UCAN key
        <p>you link to <a class="auto-link h-cassis-username" href="https://twitter.com/gordon/">@gordon/</a>composability - <a class="auto-link h-cassis-username" href="https://twitter.com/gordnon">@gordnon</a> maps to your key, and composability is a petname for your info hash in IPFS
        <p>we have a generic envelope called memos that has metadata, body ContentID, and a pointer to previous (parent) ContentID 
        <p>UCAN uses and OCAP model to enable access and editing - you own your keys [so you have to keep them safe?]
        <p>the Sphere server talks to IPFS, maps this to your public key and paths to ContentIDs, then it gossips them so you have lots fo copies, and it bridges to the web
        <p>running on the device was too battery intensive, so we run it on a web2 server [so you don't replace HTTP after all then?]

        <p class="p-summary summary">For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work.
