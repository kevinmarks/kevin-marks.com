<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.zyen.com'>Michael Mainelli</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>If you read the original Satoshi blockchain paper you can see that there is a political intent
<p>Satoshi took a technique which I call mutual distributed ledgers and combined it to construct a currency
<p>it has gone back and forth between coins and ledgers, and now coins are exciting people again
<p>you want a solid technology for your ledger, now we have gone back to the ideas of Lisp where data can be code
<p>Alderney runs a national timestamping system using one of Z/Yen's very boring ledgers
<p>I like to divide between effiecient/inefficient and no trusted 3rd party vs single trusted 3rd party
<p>the untrusted inefficient corner that bitcoin is in works for a while, but at some point you do need to trust
<p>Ethereum replaced tyranny of the code with tyranny of the majority in response to the DAO problem
<p>Everybody talks governance, but a lot of it is tosh for example, transparency is not a principle, but a tool
<p>there are many issues where there can be too much transparency - for example fleeing a repressive regime
<p>the challenge we have is the changing role of central third parties
<p>mutual distributed ledgers are not that new, but we can apply them more widely
<p>I have never seen a new technology take out an existing technology - even landlines are taking their time to go
<p>the role of governance is to help us through these transitions of technology
<p>there will be an explosion of ledgers with a central 3rd party attached - I think we'll find more use for them
<p>we have a draft for comments, we're going to give it about a week before going to print

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.zyen.com/who-we-do/people/5-about-zyen/team/1612-simon-mills.html'>Simon Mills</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we looked at the challenge of governance for Mutual Distributed Ledgers, and how rules are enforced
<p>what happens if there is a dispute? Who gets to change the software?
<p>there are 2 main types of MDL - unpermissioned ones, and ones that have a registration need via a KYC process
<p>Public MDLs fit well with a co-operative structure
<p>a state sponsored MDL matches an appointed board, an oligarchy fits a private one
<p>MDLs are often called trustless systems, but trust is essential - you need to trust the code, and transaction durability
<p>trust in an MDL does depend on those who use it and the reputation of the kinds of transactions
<p>the GDPR and the right to be forgotten do constrain how a ledger can be administered
<p>for public MDLs the anonymity of users complicates dispute resolution and enforcement
<p>Public MDLs will need terms of use and dispute resolution - a co-operative fits well with this model
<p>for State Sponsored MDLs, integrating into existing government institutions is key
<p>Estonia has set up the E-Estonia council in the prime ministers office to oversee these kind of MDLs
<p>Private MDLs will have boards mapping onto the controlling institution. A consortium like SWIFT could work
<p>I have not found any accountancy firms that have yet audited an MDL - 
<p>we may need a reality auditor to check that the assets on a blockchain do actually exist in the world

<p>a cabal within the Ethereum foundation decided to fork the code to remove the hackers spoils
<p>this means there are now two Ethereums running in parallel, one with the hackers funds
<p>The centre of excellence in MDLs is in London, not in the US

<p>many people are still very confused on governance and we can help them improve their thinking on it
<p><a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/mrmainelli">@mrmainelli</a> mentioned things like the Cadbury report that were layered on the top, but governance is fundamental

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.blackswanplc.com'>Richard Poulden</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>cryptocurrency offerings are a big problem for MDLs - these are bad money driving out good
<p>large sums of money are being raised for no reason in ICOs
<p>people are prepared to invest in a purely speculative item becasue of distrust in governments
<p>when the explosion comes in these speculative issues, the fallout will damage MDLs reputation

</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/?'>?</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>can you enshrine a constitution in a formal language that a ledger can understand?
<p>how can you define consent? Can we make liquid democracy more amenable to automation
<p>you need both privacy and reputation, but they are in tension
<p>Dash had a 'tax' on new coins that went to a foundation to fund new ideas - but most money went to 10 people
<p>is it a rigged system, or just a founder effect that gave this kind of plutocracy?
<p>we can't solve this analytically - we need to run experiments to see what actually happens
<p>you need metadata and attribution for recourse when fraud occurs - in the bitcoin world we have none of this
<p>this makes bitcoin incompatible with the existing financial world - 
<p>I bridge both worlds - I have a blockchain company and an FCA vehicle too
<p>we are deploying blockchain in IoT devices
<p>we want to blockify existing processes - enshrining the bits that need to be recorded in MDLs
<p>these are permissioned systems, and can map to existing processes more clearly
<p>we still could not find an auditor able to audit a blockchain model
<p>I think legacy is going to eat blockchain in the developed world, but the developing world doesn't have legacy ssytems
<p>what you can do now is federate in a specific and precise way, which wasn't there before
<p>A lot of people come and ask us for a blockchain without actually knowing what they might need it for

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/?'>?</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>some of the ICO offer documents that I have seen are shocking in their blatant disclaiming of all responsibility
<p>doing an ICO out of London should match existing practices, and be as clean as other kinds of money here
<p>we have the possibility of fraud and the possibility of accountability built on a system designed around anonymity

<p>accountability is transparency plus predictability in decision making
<p>business doesn't want certainty, but certainty in how the rules will be changed
<p>the process by which tax rules are changed in the UK is capricious - the chancellor pops up surprises
<p>what we need is predictability in how rules can be changed
<p>your ethical obligation is to the market as a whole  - you can't say 'my ICO is ok' when most aren't
<p>periods of great innovation are wars or bubbles. If the ICO bubble consumes the whole space we will miss the rest
<p>I'm hoping that ledgers can survive even as ICOs blow up
<p>if we have gold or property backed ICOs, they will need to be audited and protected against theft
<p>at the point we are doing this we have left the distributed ledger a long way behind
<p>the inherent advantages of a distributed ledger are lost if you build too much on top of it
<p>we have other long finance publications at <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.zyen.com/">http://www.zyen.com/</a> on pensions as well as blockchain risk
<p>the volatility of these coins plays against your ability to use them in transactions, even mentally
