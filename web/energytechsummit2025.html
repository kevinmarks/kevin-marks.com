<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I am going to try to live-skeet some of this event today <a class="auto-link" href="https://energytechsummit.co.uk/">https://energytechsummit.co.uk/</a> block the hashtag if that's annoying
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://octopus.energy/'>Greg Jackson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Octopus have previously run an energy technology summit with about 400 attendees from government etc, but instead we decided 4 weeks ago was invite 3000 cutomers to attend instead
<p>we want energy to work for and with people, not somethign that is done to us - instead of turnign our back on net zero, lets make it better for people so it's cheaper and makes our cities better
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://chrishadfield.ca'>Chris Hadfield</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we live next to a monstrous source of energy - the sun. This sends us more energy than we could ever use.
<p>The single largest release of energy in human history was the Tsar Bomba hydrogen bomb that the Soviet Union dropped in 1961 - a 50 Megaton bomb
<p>About 5% of energy in the USA currently goes to data centers, and that is expected to go up to 12% in the next few years with the growth of AI
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://octopus.energy/'>Greg Jackson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Ukraine are at the forefront of protecting Europe from aggression and before we talk about energy, I want to say how much the UK supports Ukraine
<p>Maxim is building our renewable energy in Ukraine while his power stations are under military attack. In the last year Ukarain has installed 1GW of rooftop solar - about 4% of their supply
<p>If we can inspire the Uk energy systems to learn from Ukraine and be more agile and bring costs down that helps everyone

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxim-timchenko'>Maxim Timchenko </a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We are proud to announce a partnership with Octopus with our Resilient Independent Solar Energy in Ukraine
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://michaelshanksmp.co.uk‬'>Michael Shanks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>National security is energy security - it's not by accident that Ukraine's energy infrastructure has been targetted by Russia. We're investing  in rebuilding Ukraine and bringing other investment
<p>What Ukraine shows is that continued reliance on fossil fuels is a liability for any country, and we need to build out renewables more
<p>The Russian Invasion of Ukraine showed how exposed we were to fossil fuels - we weren't using Russian Gas in the UK , but the price increase affected us too
<p>the Net Zero economy is growing 3 times faster than the rest of the economy and it is delivering jobs and growth as well as energy independence
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://octopus.energy/'>Greg Jackson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>when this war is over,  Ukraine will have the most modern, most resilient and probably most robust energy system, built around clean energy. After wars countries often grow back stronger
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://michaelshanksmp.co.uk‬'>Michael Shanks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Ukraine is a huge opportunity for investment now, and also for learning - the tech innovation that they have had to do is ahead of what we do here
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.theccc.org.uk/'>Emma Pinchbeck</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm the CEO of the Climate Change Committee <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/">https://www.theccc.org.uk/</a> working out how to meet the net zero targets
<p>The biggest things we need to do over the next 10 years are replacing gas heating with electric heating - it's already ecnomoically cheaper, so just replacement costs
<p>similarly replacing IC engine cars with electric cars is already cheaper to run, so when you change cars this is the sensible choice
<p>when you replace your heating system, geta. heat pump - it's cheaper as well as better
<p>Electric energy is already becoming carbon-free, but the big chunks in the next era is transportation and heating. in the next decade we can tackle farming and food production
<p>60% of emissions reduction from here to 2040 is electrification - replacing other powered things with electricity. We know how to do most of this
<p>Modern electric technology is much more efficient that the technlogies that it is replacing, so there is a secondary effect of electrification replacing the inefficiency overhead
<p>Electricity is more expensive than it needs to be beccsue of policy choices - we have loaded transition costs onto electricity rather than gas

Money is one of the best stories we have told
<p>Now there is another thing on the planet that could be a better storytellers than us
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/‪@stephenfry.bsky.social‬'>Stephen Fry</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>You're talking about AI as a better storyteller than us -  Emily Bender says that it is a stochastic parrot and we are the ones who make sense of them
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari'>Yuval Noah Harari</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>When I start talking I don't know what will be the next word I say either - I feel that I am reeling out words without knowing what will be next.
<p>Now you can ask AI how it thinks and see how it is froming sentences [you can't ask it and get a truthful answer, you can look at the models - this is deeply wrong- km]

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://algore.com/'>Al Gore</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Green investents generate 3 times as many jobs as fossil fuel investments
<p>it's easy to fall captive to inertia, but we have all the solutions we need today to make the energy transition work

<p>I have seen experimenters who have trained pigeons to recognise malignant versus benign tumours, and they do as well as machine learning models, but we don't have a huge campaign worrying about PIgeons taking over the world
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcelal/'>Devrim Celal</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Electricity is the perfect just-in-time delivery service. Excess or shortage are both a problem. If you get off frequency, things start to go astray
<p>20 years ago we had 4000 generaton points, now we have about 1.5 million as we now have rooftop solar etc
<p>we can no longer turn generation up and down so much, so we end up with consumers needing to help be more flexible

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://octopus.energy/'>Greg Jackson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Texas is now the most renewable state in the uS, despite Trump pushing coal and oil. Rooftop solar+ battery is 10x cheaper than grid in Africa now,  We just need to keep building it
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Sutherland_(advertising_executive)'>Rory Sutherland</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>In order for this technology shift to happen, we need a mindset change. We forget when we look back that technology adoption is a sigmoid curve
<p>There were electric cars in the Edwardian era. Becasue they were cleaner, they were mostly bought by women, the male-coded petrol engine embodied sexism
<p>if you remap a speedometer as minutes per 10 miles, it makes a lot more sense visually as speeding things up doesn't help much
<p>James Watt invented the unit of horsepower as a marketing term to sell steam engines by telling mill owners how many horses they could make redundant
<p>When they put rhen roundel on the Overground, after improving throughput, usage went up 400% - we need tis kind of epiphany for green energy
<p>what you need to do to force a paradiigm shift is come up with a creative idea rather than modelling veriables and looking at constraints
<p>How do you make using a train journey more enjoyable then using a car? [ this is the secret sauce of electric bikes - they are more fun tham electric cars-km]
<p>in 1969  Volkswagen Beetle showed a photo of the Lunar Lander with the slogan "it's ugly, but it gets you there" [also both initially built by Nazis]
<p>Paradigm shifts are not easy to achieve becsue you can't quantify every single piece of it
<p>we're spending billions to reduce range anxiety in electric cars by increasing range, we should instead make chargers more visible. Maybe by putting them at petrol stations
<p>Petrol stations are the peacocks of roads; electric chargers are hidden away behind industrial parks</div>
