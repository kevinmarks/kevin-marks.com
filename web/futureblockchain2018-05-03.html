<p>Yesterday <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/Aisha_BinBishr">@Aisha_BinBishr</a> said something that opened my eyes - she said that blockchain would make Dubai more efficient - and save everyone time spent on dealing with government 
<p>Last year CNN said that Kim Jong Un would be a big beneficiary from bitcoin, both mining it and North Korean receiving ransomware payments in bitcoin

<p>We need to build a culture of conscience around blockchain

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.blockchain-revolution.com'>Alexander Tapscott</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we are entering a 4th Industrial Age where technology is ubiquitous. Blockchain is the 2nd era of the internet, moving from the internet of information to the internet of value
<p>the double spend problem is "how when you move something of value do you not leave a copy behind?" we have solved this with middlemen historically.
<p>why do you need a thousand cryptocurrencies? Surely one is enough? there are 7 kinds of asset classes here
<p>1. Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin, Monero, Zcash, Dash and Bitcoin Cash
<p>2. Platforms - Ethereum, nem, icon etc - distributed execution of smart contracts; ethereum has also become the proto investment bank for this whole industry 
<p>3. Utility tokens - these run on ethereum and are used to pay for computation - eg the golem token
<p>4. security tokens- like an equity or bond moved onto the blockchain. These work best when there is no underlying commodity, just a contract.
<p>I believe that in the next 5 years all stock trades will move into security tokens
<p>5. Natural asset tokens - representing an underlying commodity asset in a contract
<p>6. Crypto collectibles - like cryptokitties and rare pepe - each one is unique and tradeable
<p>7. Crypto-fiat currencies and stablecoins - fiat is issued by a government; stablecoins are tied to an underlying asset like a dollar or gold
<p>venezuala claims that their Petra is backed by oil, but there is no evidence that this is true.
<p>Regulators must be careful not to pass Red flag acts - requiring a man to walk in front of a steam car to wave a red flag to not scare the horses
<p>a vote is kind of like a payment - you want to ensure that it is sent only once and counted.
<p>the man who invented chess asked for a grain of rice for the first square doubling for each square - blockchain is like that [that story is a metaphor for why exponential growth is a lousy economic model]

<p>Blockchain is here, it's real, and it is changing everyday life.
<p>Disruptors are the agents of change - people who come with big ideas and bring them to bear on countries, regions and our planet. They are heroes
<p>they're not heroes by coding in a basement, but by bringing people together in communities to effect change
<p>blockchain is about 80% business and 20% technology and the technology should be in service of the business idea
<p>David Katz has created plastic bank - enabling the worlds poor to get tokens by taking plastic out of the oceans
<p>Twiga Foods bets on blockchain to make microloans to kenyan street vendors
<p>IBM Food Trustâ„¢ is tracking how food moves from the farm to your table - simplifying tracking from 7 days down to 2.5 seconds
<p>AT IBM we're focused on a new breed of blockchain, grown fromt he legacy of cryptocurrencies
<p>we want a blockchain with accountability - knowing who you're trading with, privacy, scalability and security
<p>we have published a founders handbook - it says you need 3 things:
<p>1. Scope - dream big, but act incrementally
<p>2. Motivation - tokens are a great way to motivate a community
<p>3. Governance - the whole is bigger than the parts - blockchain enables competitors towork together
<p>we are looking for blockchain disruptors and making them discoverable so we can join forces to change the world
<p>What will we solve together? <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/ibmblockchain">@ibmblockchain</a>

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://brian.behlendorf.com'>brianbehlendorf</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>my background has been in the open source community for over 20 years - how do we bring people and companies together to build stadnards through shared sooftware
<p>we think that hyperledger will be the linux of blockchain - it is part of the linux foundation
<p>every android phone, most supercomputers and servers and every chromebook runs linux now
<p>the goal is to build on shared infrsatructrue without any company feeling that they have to own it
<p>the linux foundation has expanded beyond linux to different technology domains - eg kubernetes and letsencrypt
<p>we take the role of being the plumbers, so that if we do our job right you don't know we exist
<p>linux is 26 years old and still sees active development -10,000 line of code added a week, 5,000 removed and 25,000 changed
<p>we think of software likr apps as disposable, but frameworks need to last and you need an organisation to support them
<p>hyperledger started a couple of years ago as a way of creating shared infrsatructure for ledgers thata re more than just coins
<p>lets take these raw ideas and put them on aconveyor belt to becoming industrially reliable platforms
<p>to do that you need to build multilateral multistakeholder communities to help them outlast single company's interest
<p>2 of our porjects - sawtooth and fabric - are now enterprise ready
<p>it's not just big companies that support us but a lot fo startups too, in areas like aerospace and healthcare, banks as well as Smart Dubai as a memeber
<p>permissionless public bitcoin - permissionless private- polls, permissioned public: land title; degrees; permissioned private: medical records
<p>we have a network of ledgers that solve different needs - just as apps can use multiple APIs to connect domains
<p>we're focused on everything except enduser applications - not app layer or customer apps
<p>hyperledger Fabric is the grandaddy of our projects - it is one of the 2 key platforms that Smart Dubai has adopted
<p>one example is the Digital Trade Chain connecting Detsche Bank, HSBC and others and managing international trade
<p>the Diamond Supply Chain is in production - provenance tracking to avoid blood diamonds and conflict diamonds - tracks millions of diamonds
<p>Hyperledger Sawtooth - its like the Cassandra to Fabric's MySQL
<p>a use case here is tracking seafood tracking to verify claims for waere fisha re caught
<p>dotblokchainmedia is using sawtooth to track music rights too
<p>Hyperledger Indy is focused on self-sovereign identity, that keeps information more local to individuals rather than in centralised repositories
<p>the 6 largest banks in the Philippines are using Indy to build a KYC system 
<p>Hyperledger Burrow is a business transaction framework for smart contracts
<p>Hyperledge Quilt is a toolkit for the interledger protocol that correlates transactions between different ledgers to make atomic transactions
<p>Hyperledger has a Governing board chaired by Blyth Masters of Digital Asset and a Technical steering committee
<p>We also have a Marketing Committee
<p>I'd like to illustrate this by talking about healthcare records- use the ledger to track who has what bits of data, but the actual healthcare data is kept off the ledger
<p>if you publish data to a public ledger you can't claw that back - a public blockchain or smart contract is not revocable
<p>Community contracts like HIPAA and GDPR can't be expressed as smart contracts - they still need governance
<p>we want Minimum Viable Centralization - how do we stop the convenor of the agreements from becoming rent seeking?
<p>the best example of this so far is the domain name system and ICANN
<p>ICANN delegates out the registration to registrars who follow tehchnical standards and he Uniform Domain Name resolution protocol
<p>Software should never be the basis for enforcing hegemony
<p>we have a free introduction to hyperledger course on EdX

<p>we invest in blockchain enhancers - that support the platform and make it more efficient

<p>what is going to change is that the web 3 will break up the monopolies of web 2.0, but we have also given a printing press to everyone, and they are making bad mony
<p>projects thata re looking to embed game theory and behavioral economics are going to be a huge investment opportunity
<p>some VCs have worked around the investment rules to invest in tokens. last year there was a 1000% growth that made everyone looked good
<p>the hedge funds will come in and crash this
