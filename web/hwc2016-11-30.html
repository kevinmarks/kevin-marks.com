<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>welcome to Homebrew Website Club SF - we meet here fortnightly - in 2 weeks I can't host so we need a venue for the 14th
<p>today we've already had homebrew website clubs today in Brighton, Amsterdam, Göteborg and Baltimore
<p>some of us are posting our January 1st commitments on <a class="auto-link" href="https://indieweb.org/2017-01-01-commitments">https://indieweb.org/2017-01-01-commitments</a>
<p>I'm going to host all my RSVPs to public events on my site - <a class="auto-link" href="http://brid.gy">brid.gy</a> will do it for Facebook; lanyrd and eventbrite by hand
<p>Bear wants to read his twitter feed on his own site, and reply to posse to twitter

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tantek.com/'>Tantek Çelik</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>blog something about what you want to get working on your site by the end of the year, and add it to <a class="auto-link" href="https://indieweb.org/2017-01-01-commitments">https://indieweb.org/2017-01-01-commitments</a>

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://azarask.in'>Aza Raskin</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we are working on "the chatternet" - the internet of conversation
<p>we all hate social networks- there is a problem with a norming effect in large systems where people converge
<p>so if you post something and others don't like it, you stop posting. so how do we make this global namespace into local ones
<p>we want an open source, end to end encrypted javascript chat
<p>when you start you type in your name and get a channel - everything is a channel
<p>if you want to make a new channel you type in a hashtag and that makes one that you can post to
<p>but you can make subchannels inside a hashtag with a slash like #homebrewsf/gifs
<p>the URLs don't have a global namespace - they are yours and only show up if you link to them
<p>so it is easy to set up a channel for a spontaneous event.
<p>we made some structure, but everything is modifiable with javascript
<p>we're just a bunch of white guys in silicon valley and we don't want to force our norms on everyone, so you can change it
<p>we have an iOS app that runs javascript, so you can add your own code to it from a gist 
<p>there's a web version as well as the iOS one that has multiple panels instead of columns you flip through
<p>things we're trying to figure out are how to do federation
<p>the web version is at https://other.chat

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://upon2020.com/'>Johannes Ernst</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I blog at <a class="auto-link" href="http://upon2020.com/">http://upon2020.com/</a> - I started out that url to talk about the future, 
<p>I have been working on UBOS, a linux distribution to make it easy to install things
<p>what I want to show today is setting up websites as TOR hidden services with a single command
<p>So I can set up Ben's <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/withknown">@withknown</a> app as a TOR hidden service with ubos admin createsite --tor
<p>then it asks me for user and password and site format, then make a site for me
<p>then it gives me an onion URL I can put into the TOR browser and see my new Known site
<p>I figured that this might come in handy. UBOS runs on x86 - there's an image for amazon ec2 and raspberry pi
<p>you can backup the server as an image, and restore the hidden service to a different backend
<p>this also means you can self-host in your own home as TOR tunnels through firewalls for you
<p>adding woodwind as an app for UBOS would be a good project for someone

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://dybskiy.com'>Yuriy Dybskiy</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the project <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/aza">@aza</a> demoed fits in with a lot of the things I have been thinking about
<p>blogging to my blog is a bit hard, it has a cumbersome workflow with markdown and so on, so I need a better tool
<p>Now medium supports custom domains I can use medium as a better tool for posting, but now I'm stuck between 2 worlds
<p>so I have a github-hosted static octopress blog as well as the medium site - chances that the URLs are the same is low
<p>so, my theory of better tools making me post more didn't hold up as I haven't posted much on medium either
<p>my goals for 2017 are to figure out my web identity, at least a URL. I also have <a class="auto-link" href="http://catscadia.com">catscadia.com</a>
<p>I am also a photographer but most of my photos are on facebook 'cos of reach and people tagging. I need better workflow

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://thespeakeasysf.com/'>The speakeasy</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I have a site at <a class="auto-link" href="http://thespeakeasysf.com/">http://thespeakeasysf.com/</a> for my interactive theater club that is another reality 
<p>what we want is to make website that shows something of the real life experience
<p>I think we're looking for design, a ux person and a coder, but I'm a theater person so you know better than me
