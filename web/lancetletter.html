<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/trish-greenhalgh'>Trisha Greenhalgh</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>If you can smell the garlic on someones breath you can be infected by them.  We need to think about ventilation
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.thelancet.com'>richard horton</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Young people are more likely to become sick than to die from covid. If we reach 100,000 a day that will be 10,000 a day with Long Covid
<p>the long term impact is being seriously underestimated by only counting deaths and not long covid
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kailash-chand'>Prof Kailash Chand OBE FRCGP</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We are in a 3rd wave of the UK pandemic and the link between hospitalisations and cases is not broken, but weakened and hospital admissions growing 40% a week
<p>The NHS entered the pandemic underfunded and understaffed, and has had to weather 2 horrific waves already
<p>we will further deplete our frontline NHS workers when we have thousands of new admissions a day
<p>The fall in life expectation in some areas due to covid has amplified existing inequalities
<p>the government has chosen pursue a policy that will amplify the epidemic when we could instead vaccinate everyone within weeks
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@dgurdasani1'>Deepti Gurdasani</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>in ocotober last year 7000 scientist signed the john snow memorandum against herd immunity through natural infection <a class="auto-link" href="https://www.johnsnowmemo.com/">https://www.johnsnowmemo.com/</a>
<p>only half of our population are fully vaccinated and over 21 million people are not vaccinated at all, including children. This is the herd immunity by natural infection plan again
<p>the government knows this, and is deciding to remove protections instead of vaccinating people
<p>The logic of allowing more people to be infected is callous and inhumane
<p>the government has a responsibility to protect the public, and also to prevent the spread of the pandemic across the world
<p>the 2nd wave failure caused a variant (Alpha) to spread across Europe and the world - this is likely to incubate another variant that will spread worldwide
<p>we are fighting for a better strategy, but the government is now effectively giving up - we must not accept a policy of mass infection
<p>we have been asking for the last year to fix test trace and isolate, and make schools safer - this has been done across the world
<p>we could hold out for a few weeks more while we vaccinate the rest of the population
<p>q: has the virus explored all phenotypic options? a: we are seeing mutations happening all the time -the Delta variant is showing similar mutations to Beta too
<p>we are seeing evolution happen in real time in the virus, and we will see more adaptations unless we prevent transmission
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.alice-roberts.co.uk'>Prof Alice RobertsðŸ’™</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>q: are hospitals already struggling to cope?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://doctoroxford.com'>Rachel Clarke</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>The NhS is as overstretched as we have ever been  - A&E departments are seeing more patients than they have ever seen
<p>yesterday  Leeds had to cance cancer surgeries because there were noICU beds available due to covid cases
<p>we want to catch up with the backlog of other diseases, but every case of covid takes away staff from treating other cases
<p>we want to be doing the best we can for all the heart attack, accident and cancer patients, but allowing 100,000 cases of covid threatens that
<p>patients are often vulnerable people in society, and they are not being heard.   The immunocompromised see Freedom Day as oppression day
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kailash-chand'>Prof Kailash Chand OBE FRCGP</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I agree with Rachel - the NHS is not at breaking point, it is broken. We were 100,000 staff short before the pandemic, and it is getting worse
<p>21% of doctors have left the NHS, and mental illness is affecting doctors too - we are in a very dark place
<p>the NHS is being raun by the goodwill of the staff and not the policies of the government. The NHS reform bill will weaken this further
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.theguardian.com/profile/natalie-grover'>Natalie Grover</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I want to ask about Chris Whitty saying how opening up now could be better than the autumn
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@dgurdasani1'>Deepti Gurdasani</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>It is common sense that if you open up later you can vaccinate more people,  
<p>The model saying it would be worse in autumn is based on people losing immunity over the long term and by pupils not being vaccinated in school
<p>we could plan to fix this by booster vaccines and vaccinating children, which the model didn't include
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.alice-roberts.co.uk'>Prof Alice RobertsðŸ’™</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>q (Joe Pinkston): what data would you like to see for an unlocking to happen?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://doctoroxford.com'>Rachel Clarke</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we know that modelling exists for both numbers of deaths and hospitalisation exist, but Javid and Johnson haven't provided it
<p>the political decision is being based on date, not data and they are actively suppressing the data - show us the modelling
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.thelancet.com'>richard horton</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>people suggest that we don't want to lift mandates - that's not true. I want to see full vaccination rates to well over 70% of all population
<p>we still need to keep mask wearing. - the 3 C's 
<p>people are thinking that things are OK, and the pressure to get vaccinated is lifted
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.alice-roberts.co.uk'>Prof Alice RobertsðŸ’™</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>there does seem to be no discussion fo other mitigations eg ventilation in schools
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/trish-greenhalgh'>Trisha Greenhalgh</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>belgium have put in requirements for business to measure carbon dioxide in the buildings and show that to the public - we need to look at ventilation
<p>I see the mask as a symbol of freedom, if we are all wearing masks, we can all be free to travel, but all unmasked prevents people travelling 
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tinyurl.com/susan-michie'>Susan Michie</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we have seen huge inequalities between different populations. we are hugely reliant on people who work in public - transport, retail, delivery - and they are being put in more danger
<p>we are all in this together, because that is how infection works.  This anti-mask rhetoric is dividing us when we need to work together
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.alice-roberts.co.uk'>Prof Alice RobertsðŸ’™</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>q (barbara colmeyer): is there. a safe way for people to travel? should there be closed borders?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@Sir_David_King'>Sir David King</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>The border situation needs close examination - will other countries allow britons to travel with children who likely have the Delta variant?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.carolinelucas.com'>Caroline Lucas</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>Many MPs do share the concerns of the doctors and scientists, and when we share them in parliament, ministers have no answers too them, lying with impunity
<p>The APPG on coronavirus is asking for these health mitigations. NYC has ventilation reports for all schools
<p>how can we have an isolation system when we don't provide financial support for people to safely isolate?
<p>my question is why the government is not taking Long Covid seriously?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/trish-greenhalgh'>Trisha Greenhalgh</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>my team have been doing research into the lived experience of long covid and can confirm that this is a real disease with real suffering
<p>
<p>long covid leads to functional impairment, and many NHS workers are off sick with long covid and can't do their work
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@RichardBurgon'>Richard Burgon MP</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>hearing <a class="auto-link h-cassis-username" href="https://twitter.com/SajidJavid">@SajidJavid</a> 's libertarian dogma was chilling, painting doctors as extremists. It is a dangerous experiment
<p>It's not freedom if it puts otehr people at risk. We need sick pay at living wage levels, as those most likely to be exposed are least likely to be able to afford to self isolate
<p>the government is imposing this dangerous approach on the public, despite opposition. We need to vaccinate teenagers as other countries have
<p>the public are with us on this sensible approach - the majority believe masks should be used in public spaces and public health measures need to be improved
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://tinyurl.com/susan-michie'>Susan Michie</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>there have been U turns in the past - delaying schools going back due to pressure from scientists and teachers
<p>where the scientific arguments and data are supporting  change, we shoudl still be able to achieve a U turn
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.thelancet.com'>richard horton</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the word 'experiment' has been used - they aren't testign a hypothese - we know what will happen, that infections and hospitalisations will increase
<p>the government is pursuing an ideological commitment to force the public to accept a much higher rate of death and illness from the libertarian right
<p>it is very sad to see Vallance and Whitty give their apparent support to this ideological position
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.debbieabrahams.org.uk'>Debbie Abrahams MP</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>This is an indictment on our political system - it was felt that the government benches would not support extending health protections
<p>the disproportionate impact on poorer communities, disabled people and BAME communities needs to be challenged
<p>I asked the work and pensions select committee if they had considered the impact of long covid and they said no
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/trish-greenhalgh'>Trisha Greenhalgh</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm in this as a scientist - the facts about airborne transmission and who gets serious covid are scientific and not political, and we need to make the science available 
<p>the pints that we are making in our letter are scientific ones, not political
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@dgurdasani1'>Deepti Gurdasani</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>We do need to get many more people vaccinated, but currently children are not eligible, which means masks, better ventilation and smaller bubble sizes
<p>instead of abandoning mitigations we need to do them better
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@Dr_PhilippaW'>Dr Philippa Whitford</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>while hopsitalisation is down form 13% to 3%, with far more cases we will have far more in hospital
<p>there isn't a spare NHS to look after these new covid patients, so it will displace the other treatments
<p>people who had to shield last year will have to go back to that.
<p>
<p>my questions is what mitigations will we need to keep until next winter?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@Sir_David_King'>Sir David King</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the missing process has been to Test, Trace Isolate and treat.  We have never got this right, even in last August or in may when cases were lower
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://barbarakeeley.co.uk'>Barbara Keeley ðŸ’™ ðŸ˜·</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I'm a member of health select committee and APPG coronavirus - the impact on non covid services is huge, and our NHS staff are burnt out
<p>Freedom day is not freedom for the immunosuppressed - after protecting and shielding for 18 months they will not be able to go out
<p>in salford we have only reached 46% with 2 vaccine doses, and we have had doses restricted - one week only 2000 doses
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.alice-roberts.co.uk'>Prof Alice RobertsðŸ’™</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>do we have an idea of the proportion of population who are vulnerable?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.ft.com/science'>Clive Cookson</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>why is this so politically polarized? why no conservatives joining this?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@RichardBurgon'>Richard Burgon MP</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>the debate returns to the fundamental divide in politics between liberty and equality - we shouldn't be pitting personal responsibility against the collective we need both
<p>we do need to look at the causes of inequality that have made poorer people more vulnerable to the covid pandemic
<p>we should be wearing masks - they are a symbol of out commitment to one another, as my mask protects you
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.alice-roberts.co.uk'>Prof Alice RobertsðŸ’™</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>clare hasty: we have protections against second hand smoke, and I think we need recourse in law for long covid too
<p>q: why are you not arguing fro more restrictions when we are already in a 3rd wave?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@dgurdasani1'>Deepti Gurdasani</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we areguing for mroe mitigations - cases are doubling every 9 days, and we are arguing for more mitigations, especially including ventilation
<p>we need to adopt the mitigations that have impact that prevent us having lockdowns - south east asia had far fewer because they did prevention and mitigation right
