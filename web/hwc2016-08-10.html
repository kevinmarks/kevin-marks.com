<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I got my Alexa Echo - so the NSA can now listen to my living room -  I want it to tell me what my friends are doing
<p>I want to ask my Alexa what's Kevin up to tonight? I have an idea of how this could work
<p>I want my domain to act as the source of truth for what I'm doing, either publicly or more privately
<p> I want to tie this into our own domains - what meetings, what conferences, what deals?

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/sdepolo'>Stacey DePolo</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I had Siri working well for me, but it seemed to change with a new release
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I find echo works really well, and Siri never worked for me because of my accent
<p>I wrote a web-based voice bot myself and it runs on android phones, but not iOS
<p>what's interesting is to move this beyond one domain and make it flexible
<p>one thing the silos do is simplify installing and maintenance - it is a matter of UX
<p>I find that if I'm in a bar and want to share something, I use instagram not my own code

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/sdepolo'>Stacey DePolo</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I do wonder as millennials take over, will the more hidden take over - will they go back to old web werdness?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>did you see that orkut relaunched as <a class="auto-link" href="http://hello.com">hello.com</a> this week? no, not <a class="auto-link" href="http://ello.com">ello.com</a>, Hello

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>how blogging worked in 2000 we'd click through our blogroll each morning and see our friends stories. That's snapchat
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://flatfro.com'>Jeremy Llewellyn</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>with snapchat it was the first time I could send context with what I was doing, not just text - nothing did that
<p>now you  just hold your phone and you have video context as well
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://kevinmarks.com'>Kevin Marks</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>one thing snapchat enabled was quick facial reactions - not myfacewhen, but my actual face
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>when did twitter bring in live video reactions? was that recently?
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/sdepolo'>Stacey DePolo</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>yes, they had periscope but they put it in the app recently
<p>at godaddy we gave up email responses and went to live responses and chat and it was better - context wins
<p>if you still need email support there is godaddy pro, but the live context makes it better
<p>They hired non-technical people because it was easier to teach people to be technical than to teach techs to be nice
</blockquote></div>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://werd.io/'>Ben Werdmüller</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>context and privacy are related - we've done dumb writes well - not sure who we're addressing
<p>all the platforms we have now are proofs of concept, but the only make sense with context we speak to
