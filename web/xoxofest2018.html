<p>I took fewer notes this time at XOXO - spending my time feeding transcripts to twitter did not feel in the spirit of a festival where so many speakers and attendees had had their livelihoods and voice threatened by harassment on twitter - I spent more time listening and thinking than typing.
<p>As in previous years, I came away from XOXO having celebrated people who make wonderful things online and off, and bring communities together through their creativity; creating and cherishing the publics that form around their works. I met many old friends and colleagues, and talked about the state of the web and how we can rescue it from the silos that grind it into slurry for their streams.
<p><a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">Hapgood</a> talks about the web as garden and stream:
<blockquote><p>The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. Itâ€™s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.
<p>In the stream metaphor you donâ€™t experience the Stream by walking around it and looking at it, or following it to its end. You jump in and let it flow past. You feel the force of it hit you as things float by.</blockquote>
<p>XOXO felt like a return to the garden, a respite from the stream. I need to reflect on this more, and bring back the idea of Tummeling as a practice of the web as prta of my indieweb work.

<p>to make community is to seek community.I turned to the internet to look for the feeling of being in a writer's room, and I found weird twitter
<p>the relationships we form online are real, and XOXO shows that. The internet is place for working out who you are
<p>one of the powers of the internet is making us realize we are all outsiders, but we're all outsiders together. 
<p>people follow me expecting humour, but I can retweet things about social justice written by people who are smarter about it than me, and be the trojan horse
<p>I've been thinking about tweets as things that create conversation spaces - you create a little micro community in the replies to a tweet
<p>I pitched "everyone's an aliebn when ur an aliebn too" as a little funny book of comics, but I wanted to adapt the narrative structure of a the twitter timeline to a book
<p>the alien comes to earth and meets a lot of characters, and then you see updates from them as you move through the book
<p>take the things that you are experiencing online, and translate them into different mediums

<p>you can join the Unicode Consortium as a non-voting member for $75
<p>Emoji is OK at nouns, emotions and active verbs, but it has no notion of I or You
<p>in 2015 there were only 4 roles women could play on the emoji keyboard - Princess, Bride, Dancer or Playboy Bunny
<p>I have a female friend who is also a CEO who says "I can't see the point of being a mom - it doesn't scale"
<p>children now talk with emoji before they use words - it is a pidgin now, but they will make it a creole
<p>people pushing back on emoji that represent others is a failure of theory of mind

<p>Twitter has been the biggest tool to get me a sustainable career, and a community to help me figure out what is funny
<p>Twitter is an incubator for everything good and badâ€” it magnifies marginalized voices, and magnifies all your fuck ups too 
<p>Twitter gets us all closer to each other but it also becomes a megaphone for the worst people
<p>Comedy can't exist without the space between the laughs. When everything is funny, nothing is comedy.
<p>I get upset with people insist on only communicating with me by referencing my jokes, because subconsciously I know that is what I have been doing.

<div class='notercite h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://clairelevans.com/'>Claire L Evans</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>I grew up on the computer, and when the web came along, it was my country
<p>But it stopped feeling safe for me a couple of years ago - I researched the history of technology to find a lineage of women to look up to
<p>This is my friend Stacey Horn who founded a BBS in the 1990s -East Coast Hang out  -  echo
<p>back in the 1980s there were only about 10% women on line, and many of us hid behind male handles so we wouldn't be harassed
<p>on echo it was about 40% women - Stacy wanted more women on echo to make it better - she made access free for women free for an entire year
<p>when a woman quit echo she would call them personally and ask if they were OK
<p>Online communities then were moderated by hosts - users deputized to set the tone
<p>on echo, every conversation had both a mana and a woman as hosts
<p>echo still exists now - Stacy never sold, franchised or IPO'd - the only to get an account is to send in the mail for a brochure
<p>what if the architects of our present day social environments had made the same efforts about inclusion that Stacy made early on?
<p>This is Wendy Hall - she was obsessed with this new-fangled thing called Hypertext - she was inspired by the Domesday Project from the BBC in 1986
<p>The Domesday Discs contained virtual reality walks around places, photos and narrative about the UK in 1986
<p>Wendy Hall built a system to navigate library images through a system called microcosm
<p>On the web, links are contextual - they're embedded in documents - when one goes down they are broken. microcosm kept all the links separate in a database - they were an overlay on documents
<p>in the late 1980s there were lots of hypertext systems, and nearly every one had women in leading positions
<p>When Tim Berners-Lee presented the WWW at hypertext 1991 - they thought it was too primitive because the links only go in one direction
<p>the web borrowed a lot of ideas from the earlier hypertext systems - it grew from a community of ideas
<p>Computing has always been as much a women's job as a boys club
<p>women earned 40% of computer science degrees up until 1984
<p>if there is a boys club that dominates silicon valley today, it is an exception in time.
