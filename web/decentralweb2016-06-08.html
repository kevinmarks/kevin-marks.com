<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://archive.org'>Wendy Hanamura</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>we're live streaming this at <a class="auto-link" href="http://www.decentralizedweb.net">www.decentralizedweb.net</a> so watch along
<p>if you haven't been to the Internet Archive before, we think of this as our Temple of knowledge
<p>we're one of the largest digital libraries in the world - if you look at the back of the room you can see servers
<p>the library of congress, if digitised, would fit in about an inch and a half of one of those servers
<p>the Ford foundation got together Mitchell Baker, Brewster Kahle and Tim Berners-Lee and asked for a moonshot
<p>rather than talk about the new library of Alexandria, Brewster talked about Locking the Web open for good
<p>many of you are the builders of the next decentralized web and baking openness into your code #indieweb
<p>Joi Ito likes to talk about the conspiracy of open - Mozilla, Internet archive, wikimedia, EFF keeping the web open

<h2>Mitchell Baker - Mozilla Chair</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/'>Mitchell Baker</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>today we have 2 concepts: Decentralized and the Web - I want to talk about the Web
<p>you might think that the web is about the browser; or that the web is about HTTP 
<p>the web is not about a particular technology but about 4 key principles
<p>while we build a decentralised web or a Web of Things, what do we care about?
<p>1. The web is Immediate. Safe instant access to content via a universal address without needing install
<p>2. The web is Open. Anyone can publish content without permission or barrier and provide access as they see fit.
<p>3. The web is Universal. Content runs on any device or platform. We do this through standards.
<p>The w3c has a Social Web working group, and Mozilla is active in this.
<p>4. The Web has agency. A User Agent can choose how to interpret content provided by a service on your behalf.
<p>The breoser can change typeface, protect you from malware, prevent tracking. The browser works on your behalf
<p>as we think about the decentralized web, these key traits show up: Immediate, Open, Universal, Agency.

<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://archive.org'>Wendy Hanamura</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>for the last few years Vint Cerf has been talking about the digital dark age - content blinks on and off
<p>We built the Wayback Machine to give the web a memory, but that's a patch
<p>Vint said "we all die" "when I die I want there to be  a record of what I did on this earth"
</blockquote></div>
<h2>Vint Cerf</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://research.google.com/pubs/author32412.html'>Vint Cerf</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>there's nothing more satisfying than being the chief internet evangelist in this room
<p>May all your packets land in the right bit bucket [amen]
<p>Lessons learned form the Internet:
<p>Collaboration and Cooperation were key to the internet - get everything talking to each other
<p>open design and evolution was key, and anyone can join by following protocols
<p>we didn't impose any business models on anyone, so you can choose how you do it
<p>modualrity is key, layered evolution has been enabled by information hiding 
<p>E pluribus Unem - from many networks we made one thing, the Internet
<p>thinking about archiving there are a series of things we need
<p>Compression schemes like tarball and so on only let you store and recover particular objects
<p>storage and software with versions is now growing and possible
<p>but the web is a complex structure that connects lots of things together
<p>the internet archive takes static snapshots of web pages that are time-indexed
<p>the hyperlinks need to be re-formed to resolve to in-Archive pages so it can be self-contained
<p>this archive requires continuous crawling, and decide when it is a new instance
<p>a system that is accumulating web pages - can the set of all sets contain itself - is the archive in the archive?
<p>the web can barely contain itself as it is - can LOCKSS work - is there space to replicate it?
<p>Hyperlinks deteriorate over time - do we need a permanent link system?
<p>HTML rendering needs to be backward compatible - event he earliest HTML still renders well, but there are hazards
<p>I uploaded my slides from powerpoint to google docs, and found google docs can't render TIFF though PPT did
<p>I have some 1997 powerpoint slides - I pulled up one in current word, and it was corrupted.
<p>Power corrupts, Powerpoint corrupts absolutely.
<p>there are issues with permissions on things that the web points too
<p>I would like for web pages to be automaticallly replicated and archived as we edit and publish them
<p>I'm not sure I want all my edits shared and archived, but certainly all my published versions
<p>Is there a role fro the Google Docs like real-time replication and synchronisation?
<p>coudl we have a common refene scheme across copies
<p>is there a role for a Pub/Sub mechanism for co-operating archive entities? 
<p> lot of metadata is needed to replicate the Time Machine of the Wayback machine
<p>it is OK to have control of replication and distribution while still archiving what we can
<p>the other question is can we render the objects pointed to - we need software to do that
<p>50 years from now we may have software that no longer runs, which means we need to emulate old hardware
<p>running old windows versions in emulation in the cloud - we will need to get legal rights to do this
<p>imagine that there are multiple alternative resolution targets for a link - doesn't matter which is used
<p>when we move around copies of things, how do we make sure we can still point to them
<p>newspapers and magazines have editions; on the web we may need snapshots at intervals, or define editions
<p>desirable: automatic archiving on publication - a service you sign up for? how funded? [ask <a class="auto-link h-x-username" href="https://twitter.com/pinboard">@pinboard</a>]
<p>registration of rendering engines and permission systems
<p>Do we have automatic malware filters? How do we know it is safe
<p>do we have varying fidelity levels - everything, surface visuals without links, what else drops out
<p>how do we even describe how we have lowered fidelity and why
<p>once archived, is a page an indelible instance usable in a court of law?
<p>does this make an official record?
<p>could we make this self-archive be encrypted and unloaked after 25 years?
<p>what metadata can I put in to trigger opening up access after time
<p>Wrapping in containers may be a way to preserve the software as well as gardware

<h2>Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='https://twitter.com/@timberners_lee'>Tim Berners-Lee</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>thanks for inviting me and thank you everyone for coming re-decentralizing the web is a topic near to my heart
<p>anybody who just woke up here in a yellow light-filled church with sacred relics containing all human knowledge
<p>Vint and Bob Kahn had done their work 20 years before -1969 vs 89 - totally different music
<p>the internet was their and I could use it - my boss did write "vague but interesting" on my proposal
<p>my intent was to make something Universal - I has seen a lot of documentation systems that made you use theirs
<p>some were matrix oriented, some were tree oriented, there was this heterogeneity of systems
<p>we had to put code on these documentation systems to convert them into universal web pages
<p>HTML had a lot in common with the SGML markup that people were using in my department
<p>HTTP was a concoction of SMTP-like headers with the HTML content
<p>the URL, then called the UDI, was made to look as much like a unix path name as possible
<p>the double slash came from the Apollo name system, where it could refer to another machine
<p>incremental change and only adding the pieces that we needed was key
<p>it was never clear that the web would take off, but it dif
<p>the internet was designed without the nation being a concept- it's not obvious where users were
<p>making a website was downloading the code, running the httpd daemon and putting pages on the web
<p>so just by linking from your blog to other people we made a web of intelligent discussion
<p>in the years that followed, many wonderful things have been done on top of the web
<p>creativity  built many wonderful things, even giant social networks where people spend all their time
<p>when you talk to people they are quite frustrated - they have their friends on facebook, photos on flickr 
<p>then you want to share between the systems, you have to import either photos or lists of friends
<p>you have to build an app, learn the flickr api and the facebook api and everything is stuck in silos [brid,gy]
<p>the web was designed to be decentralised so everyone could participate by having their own name and domain
<p>but instead everything is locked up in silos
<p>the consumer gets a lot of things for free, but they sold their soul of privacy to the marketing machine
<p>you suddenly get targetted with all kinds of things - because the system realises that you have a child
<p>the only way to make money on the net seems to be with advertising
<p>what's wrong with this picture? It's a myth. We don't have to be happy with this.
<p>when I go for a run my wristband tracks my run and them gets uploaded to the ibternet
<p>if I uplaod all my running it can maybe work out when I need new shoes, but that isn't that valuable
<p>the proposal is to bring back the idea of a decentralised web - power to the people
<p>breaking the model where all your data is in different silos - we have project called solid
<p>we're going to use web technology but separate the acts from the data that is used
<p>when we store data where we want, we can have apps that connect to more than just one silo
<p>we had to use the domain name system because it was there, but we could add a .archive TLD to back things up
<p>there are systems that say "let's not use human readable names" - but they can be tricky
<p>you should think of the URL as a name, not a location - you can attach public/private keys to it as a name
<p>what we are all aiming for is to make the web better in lots of ways and more reliable
<p>with HTML sub-resource integrity when you link you can give its hash as well to check it is what you linked to
<p>a lot of the issues about naming, about should we fix DNS?
<p>when I come up with a name like '<a class="auto-link" href="http://whencanwemeet.com">whencanwemeet.com</a>' they want to sell it to me for $100,000 - not good
<p>we write standards on how these different projects can use different pieces of each other
<p>The Social Web Working group at the W3C is very much a part of this work
<p>the web authentication working group is also a related area
<p>I expect to see the merging of the world of sync and bits of the cloud, and the web itself
<p>a lot of websites now have links to git repositories for their history - maybe we should surface that history
<p>when we can see commonalities and difference between versions, you can have distributed sync and editing
<p>I wanted to say how I am frustrated with silos, and excited that we are going to re-decentralize the web

<h2>Brewster Kahle – "Locking the Web Open – a Call for a New, Decentralized Web"</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://archive.org'>Brewster Kahle</a>:  
<p>This has been a fabulous coming together towards rethinking what we might build out there
<p>Tim Berners-Lee said http is not cast in stone we can see what it would become
<p>there is opportunity and possibility here to chaneg things
<p>Jeff Ubois said "can we lock the web open?"
<p>over the last 25 years we have had millions pour our lives inot the web
<p>as Larry Lessig says Code is Law and our code defines the web
<p>the way that we code the web will say alot about how we live our lives online
<p>we want to represent the values and structures we want to reinforce and enable
<p>we shoudl encourage universal accuracy to all knowledge
<p>we want the firts amendment baked inot it
<p>the web is huge - we collect a billion web pages each week - it has attracted people to come together
<p>but it's not available everywhere - in china and russia yhou can't get t the internet archive
<p>web pages blink on and off line - the average life of a webpage is 100 days
<p>it's a very ephemeral mediuam, and it is also not private
<p>GCHQ, the UK's NSA equivalent watched all of the readers of wikileaks and handed them to the NSA
<p>in the library world the idea of being watched as you read has a long and dreadful history
<p>so being afraid to follow a link is a terrible thing
<p>but the web is fun - it's jungle out there but it's fun jungle
<p>the web isn't reliable, it isn't private, but it is fun - 1 out of 3 -we can go for the trifecta
<p>the idea of building a decentralized system I want to distinguish the web from the internet
<p>with the intrenet, any piece can get nuked and it will still work - it is resilient to certain kinds of failure
<p>a decentralized system is more difficult to make than a centralised one
<p>if you watch all the people transiting an isp to a webserver you can block people
<p>the internet isn't like that. I asked Vint how hard it was, and it was 5 guys locked in a room for a year
<p>the Amazon cloud has large scale use and datacenters all over the world - they'll move to different servers
<p>this kind of migration based on use is desirable - can we make the decentralized web do that?
<p>we want ot make it reader-private - Wikipedia is a wonderful thing fro people like me who should to know things
<p>also writer private is important, and that is easier than reader-private
<p>lets build a time axis into this new web - let not have to make a kludge like the wayback machine
<p>lets archive not just what the website looks like but the websites themselves and their data
<p>can we make it live in multiple places and be able to roll it back in time?
<p>and can we make it so that people can make money on the decentralized web without a 3rd party?
<p>we have some technologies that are fricking awesome
<p>one is javascript - it was mind-blowing when the archive team made it possibel to run old PCs in the browser
<p>the idea of a 15-year old computer system playing oregon trail in javascript was a lightbulb for me
<p>we can use javascript for the operating system of a new web
<p>at the time the intrenet was invented, encryption was illegal
<p>we won those crypto wars int he 1990s, so now we cn use crypto adn
<p>for peer to peer, Bram Cohen and Bittorrent have made peer to peer work; with WebRTC you can do it in browser
<p>with signing and encryption you can know that you are not getting a corrupted version
<p>With blockchain and bitcoin you have a money system and also an API to money
<p>but the mind blow fro me was only the stupid survive - only the simple systems live
<p>these are not simple systems - they are complicated but succesful
<p>we can build a system out of some of these component to do something intersting
<p>about 25% of websites are build on wordpress - can we make a decentralized wordpress so you don't need a  server
<p>could we serve a wordpress equivalent from everywhere and nowhere?
<p>we want it to work on existing browsers so you can use it on your phones without downloading anything
<p>it's got to have good naming and snappy performance
<p>it's got to be fun to post and comment, and it needs an identity system to delegate authority
<p>extra points if someone can put a bitcoin in a slot to pay for your songs
<p>and we need archiving along the way
<p>javascript as an operating system is viable now - we cna build these places out
<p>I am going to do a live demo of linking to http:127 something and a big hash and it will retrieve on mu machine
<p>it will retrive from a distributed system and show my blog and a search field for it
<p>if I search "vint" it is running code in my browser you'd normally do server side
<p>We need easy names - there's namecoin in the room; maybe etherium could do names so we don't type hashe
<p>we're going to need institutions that will serve at high speed, like the archive and ISPs and CDNs
<p>ISPs want to make things faster - so it's like everyone has akamai built in
<p>updates of decentralization is not trivial - mutable torrents and IPSF do make this work
<p>a decentralized identity system - bitcoin addresses for signing posts? soild crypto and existing tools
<p>if we can piggyback on someon elsese system we can make that work
<p>so we can ahve wordpress, but decentralized. A lot fo the pieces actullly exist and need to be put together
<p>we want a reliable, private and fun piece of infrastructure we can use fro a very long time
<p>we can lock the web open, bake the first amendment into the code and make it irrevocable
<p>we can extend the work of Vint, Tim Berners-Lee and Mozilla foundation and build something now on top of it

<h2>Cory Doctorow – "How Stupid Laws and Benevolent Dictators can Ruin the Decentralized Web, too"</h2>
<div class='h-cite'><a class='h-card p-category' href='http://craphound.com'>Cory Doctorow</a>:  <blockquote class='e-content'><p>this is like being back at the O'Reilly P2P conference in 1989
<p>I'm here to give dieting advice. When you go on a diet: throw away all your oreos
<p>if you're serious about not eating Oreos, your best bet is not to have a bag to eat
<p>use your willpower now to get rid of the Oreos so you don't eat them when your will is weak
<p>it's called a Ulysses pact, after his journey with the sirens - make sure he can't fail due to later weak will
<p>it's very tempting to centralize things - there are lots of advantages to it
<p>the way the web got centralized today was because people like you made compromises
<p>we only sense relative difference, not absolute ones, so each compromise is incremental
<p>before you know it you're suing to copyright your code or putting in back doors fro the NSA
<p>I am not better than the people who made those compromises: you are not better than them
<p>we hyperbolically discount future costs comapred to present benefits
<p>if you don't want to eat oreos in the middle of the night, make it harder so you need your car to buy them
<p>the way to avoid making compromises in future is to take them off the table in the present
<p>Brewster said this when we could use google docs' JS libraries to build p2p
<p>the GPL worked at locking things open by not being able to compromise
<p>eventually it became absurd that you would pay licences to spin up VMs, so GPL'd linux won
<p>sometimes companies want to commoditize their rivals product
<p>systems that work well but fail badly are doomed to die in flames - the GPL fails well
<p>Microsoft was right to be freaked out by the GPL - their programmerrs had the instinct for openness
<p>the GPL worked so well, no-one ever sued them
<p>DRM Digital Rights Management tries to take over your computer to enforce you not seeing things
<p>DRM is legally enforced anti-tampering - it's being used by ford to force you to buy their parts
